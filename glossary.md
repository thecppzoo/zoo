### Associative Iteration:
Defined in code, [associative_iteration.h](https://github.com/thecppzoo/zoo/blob/8f2e29d48194fb17bbf79688106bd28f44f7e11c/inc/zoo/swar/associative_iteration.h#L366-L387).
Will be upgraded to a recursive template that changes function arguments and return types in a way in which the new return type is the same as the next recursive invocation argument type.
