the turn of the screw
the story had held us round the fire sufficiently breathless but
except the obvious remark that it was gruesome as on christmas eve in
an old house a strange tale should essentially be i remember no
comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the only case
he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child the case
i may mention was that of an apparition in just such an old house as
had gathered us for the occasion an appearance of a dreadful kind to
a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in
the terror of it waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him
to sleep again but to encounter also herself before she had
succeeded in doing so the same sight that had shaken him it was this
observation that drew from douglas not immediately but later in the
evening a reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call
attention someone else told a story not particularly effective which
i saw he was not following this i took for a sign that he had himself
something to produce and that we should only have to wait we waited in
fact till two nights later but that same evening before we scattered
he brought out what was in his mind
i quite agree in regard to griffin s ghost or whatever it was that
its appearing first to the little boy at so tender an age adds a
particular touch but it s not the first occurrence of its charming
kind that i know to have involved a child if the child gives the
effect another turn of the screw what do you say to _two_ children
we say of course somebody exclaimed that they give two turns
also that we want to hear about them
i can see douglas there before the fire to which he had got up to
present his back looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in
his pockets nobody but me till now has ever heard it s quite too
horrible this naturally was declared by several voices to give the
thing the utmost price and our friend with quiet art prepared his
triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on it s
beyond everything nothing at all that i know touches it
for sheer terror i remember asking
he seemed to say it was not so simple as that to be really at a loss
how to qualify it he passed his hand over his eyes made a little
wincing grimace for dreadful dreadfulness
oh how delicious cried one of the women
he took no notice of her he looked at me but as if instead of me he
saw what he spoke of for general uncanny ugliness and horror and
pain
well then i said just sit right down and begin
he turned round to the fire gave a kick to a log watched it an
instant then as he faced us again i can t begin i shall have to
send to town there was a unanimous groan at this and much reproach
after which in his preoccupied way he explained the story s
written it s in a locked drawer it has not been out for years i could
write to my man and enclose the key he could send down the packet as
he finds it it was to me in particular that he appeared to propound
this appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate he had broken a
thickness of ice the formation of many a winter had had his reasons
for a long silence the others resented postponement but it was just
his scruples that charmed me i adjured him to write by the first post
and to agree with us for an early hearing then i asked him if the
experience in question had been his own to this his answer was prompt
oh thank god no
and is the record yours you took the thing down
nothing but the impression i took that _here_ he tapped his heart
i ve never lost it
then your manuscript
is in old faded ink and in the most beautiful hand he hung fire
again a woman s she has been dead these twenty years she sent me
the pages in question before she died they were all listening now
and of course there was somebody to be arch or at any rate to draw the
inference but if he put the inference by without a smile it was also
without irritation she was a most charming person but she was ten
years older than i she was my sister s governess he quietly said
she was the most agreeable woman i ve ever known in her position she
would have been worthy of any whatever it was long ago and this
episode was long before i was at trinity and i found her at home on
my coming down the second summer i was much there that year it was a
beautiful one and we had in her off hours some strolls and talks in
the garden talks in which she struck me as awfully clever and nice oh
yes don t grin i liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think
she liked me too if she hadn t she wouldn t have told me she had
never told anyone it wasn t simply that she said so but that i knew
she hadn t i was sure i could see you ll easily judge why when you
hear
because the thing had been such a scare
he continued to fix me you ll easily judge he repeated _you_
will
i fixed him too i see she was in love
he laughed for the first time you _are_ acute yes she was in love
that is she had been that came out she couldn t tell her story
without its coming out i saw it and she saw i saw it but neither of
us spoke of it i remember the time and the place the corner of the
lawn the shade of the great beeches and the long hot summer
afternoon it wasn t a scene for a shudder but oh he quitted the
fire and dropped back into his chair
you ll receive the packet thursday morning i inquired
probably not till the second post
well then after dinner
you ll all meet me here he looked us round again isn t anybody
going it was almost the tone of hope
everybody will stay
_i_ will and _i_ will cried the ladies whose departure had been
fixed mrs griffin however expressed the need for a little more
light who was it she was in love with
the story will tell i took upon myself to reply
oh i can t wait for the story
the story _won t_ tell said douglas not in any literal vulgar
way
more s the pity then that s the only way i ever understand
won t _you_ tell douglas somebody else inquired
he sprang to his feet again yes tomorrow now i must go to bed good
night and quickly catching up a candlestick he left us slightly
bewildered from our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on
the stair whereupon mrs griffin spoke well if i don t know who she
was in love with i know who _he_ was
she was ten years older said her husband
_raison de plus_ at that age but it s rather nice his long
reticence
forty years griffin put in
with this outbreak at last
the outbreak i returned will make a tremendous occasion of
thursday night and everyone so agreed with me that in the light of
it we lost all attention for everything else the last story however
incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial had been told we
handshook and candlestuck as somebody said and went to bed
i knew the next day that a letter containing the key had by the first
post gone off to his london apartments but in spite of or perhaps
just on account of the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite
let him alone till after dinner till such an hour of the evening in
fact as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes
were fixed then he became as communicative as we could desire and
indeed gave us his best reason for being so we had it from him again
before the fire in the hall as we had had our mild wonders of the
previous night it appeared that the narrative he had promised to read
us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue
let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative
from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall
presently give poor douglas before his death when it was in
sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of
these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to
read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth the
departing ladies who had said they would stay didn t of course thank
heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a
rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with
which he had already worked us up but that only made his little final
auditory more compact and select kept it round the hearth subject to
a common thrill
the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up
the tale at a point after it had in a manner begun the fact to be in
possession of was therefore that his old friend the youngest of
several daughters of a poor country parson had at the age of twenty
on taking service for the first time in the schoolroom come up to
london in trepidation to answer in person an advertisement that had
already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser this
person proved on her presenting herself for judgment at a house in
harley street that impressed her as vast and imposing this prospective
patron proved a gentleman a bachelor in the prime of life such a
figure as had never risen save in a dream or an old novel before a
fluttered anxious girl out of a hampshire vicarage one could easily
fix his type it never happily dies out he was handsome and bold and
pleasant off hand and gay and kind he struck her inevitably as
gallant and splendid but what took her most of all and gave her the
courage she afterward showed was that he put the whole thing to her as
a kind of favor an obligation he should gratefully incur she
conceived him as rich but as fearfully extravagant saw him all in a
glow of high fashion of good looks of expensive habits of charming
ways with women he had for his own town residence a big house filled
with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to
his country home an old family place in essex that he wished her
immediately to proceed
he had been left by the death of their parents in india guardian to a
small nephew and a small niece children of a younger a military
brother whom he had lost two years before these children were by the
strangest of chances for a man in his position a lone man without the
right sort of experience or a grain of patience very heavily on his
hands it had all been a great worry and on his own part doubtless a
series of blunders but he immensely pitied the poor chicks and had
done all he could had in particular sent them down to his other house
the proper place for them being of course the country and kept them
there from the first with the best people he could find to look after
them parting even with his own servants to wait on them and going down
himself whenever he might to see how they were doing the awkward
thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own
affairs took up all his time he had put them in possession of bly
which was healthy and secure and had placed at the head of their
little establishment but below stairs only an excellent woman mrs
grose whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly
been maid to his mother she was now housekeeper and was also acting
for the time as superintendent to the little girl of whom without
children of her own she was by good luck extremely fond there were
plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go
down as governess would be in supreme authority she would also have
in holidays to look after the small boy who had been for a term at
school young as he was to be sent but what else could be done and
who as the holidays were about to begin would be back from one day to
the other there had been for the two children at first a young lady
whom they had had the misfortune to lose she had done for them quite
beautifully she was a most respectable person till her death the great
awkwardness of which had precisely left no alternative but the school
for little miles mrs grose since then in the way of manners and
things had done as she could for flora and there were further a
cook a housemaid a dairywoman an old pony an old groom and an old
gardener all likewise thoroughly respectable
so far had douglas presented his picture when someone put a question
and what did the former governess die of of so much respectability
our friend s answer was prompt that will come out i don t
anticipate
excuse me i thought that was just what you _are_ doing
in her successor s place i suggested i should have wished to learn
if the office brought with it
necessary danger to life douglas completed my thought she did wish
to learn and she did learn you shall hear tomorrow what she learned
meanwhile of course the prospect struck her as slightly grim she was
young untried nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little
company of really great loneliness she hesitated took a couple of
days to consult and consider but the salary offered much exceeded her
modest measure and on a second interview she faced the music she
engaged and douglas with this made a pause that for the benefit of
the company moved me to throw in
the moral of which was of course the seduction exercised by the
splendid young man she succumbed to it
he got up and as he had done the night before went to the fire gave
a stir to a log with his foot then stood a moment with his back to us
she saw him only twice
yes but that s just the beauty of her passion
a little to my surprise on this douglas turned round to me it _was_
the beauty of it there were others he went on who hadn t
succumbed he told her frankly all his difficulty that for several
applicants the conditions had been prohibitive they were somehow
simply afraid it sounded dull it sounded strange and all the more so
because of his main condition
which was
that she should never trouble him but never never neither appeal nor
complain nor write about anything only meet all questions herself
receive all moneys from his solicitor take the whole thing over and
let him alone she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that
when for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking
her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
but was that all her reward one of the ladies asked
she never saw him again
oh said the lady which as our friend immediately left us again
was the only other word of importance contributed to the subject till
the next night by the corner of the hearth in the best chair he
opened the faded red cover of a thin old fashioned gilt edged album
the whole thing took indeed more nights than one but on the first
occasion the same lady put another question what is your title
i haven t one
oh _i_ have i said but douglas without heeding me had begun to
read with a fine clearness that was like a rendering to the ear of the
beauty of his author s hand
i
i remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops a
little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong after rising in town
to meet his appeal i had at all events a couple of very bad days found
myself doubtful again felt indeed sure i had made a mistake in this
state of mind i spent the long hours of bumping swinging coach that
carried me to the stopping place at which i was to be met by a vehicle
from the house this convenience i was told had been ordered and i
found toward the close of the june afternoon a commodious fly in
waiting for me driving at that hour on a lovely day through a
country to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly
welcome my fortitude mounted afresh and as we turned into the avenue
encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to
which it had sunk i suppose i had expected or had dreaded something
so melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise i remember as a
most pleasant impression the broad clear front its open windows and
fresh curtains and the pair of maids looking out i remember the lawn
and the bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and
the clustered treetops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the
golden sky the scene had a greatness that made it a different affair
from my own scant home and there immediately appeared at the door
with a little girl in her hand a civil person who dropped me as decent
a curtsy as if i had been the mistress or a distinguished visitor i
had received in harley street a narrower notion of the place and that
as i recalled it made me think the proprietor still more of a
gentleman suggested that what i was to enjoy might be something beyond
his promise
i had no drop again till the next day for i was carried triumphantly
through the following hours by my introduction to the younger of my
pupils the little girl who accompanied mrs grose appeared to me on
the spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have
to do with her she was the most beautiful child i had ever seen and i
afterward wondered that my employer had not told me more of her i
slept little that night i was too much excited and this astonished me
too i recollect remained with me adding to my sense of the
liberality with which i was treated the large impressive room one of
the best in the house the great state bed as i almost felt it the
full figured draperies the long glasses in which for the first time
i could see myself from head to foot all struck me like the
extraordinary charm of my small charge as so many things thrown in it
was thrown in as well from the first moment that i should get on with
mrs grose in a relation over which on my way in the coach i fear i
had rather brooded the only thing indeed that in this early outlook
might have made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being
so glad to see me i perceived within half an hour that she was so
glad stout simple plain clean wholesome woman as to be positively
on her guard against showing it too much i wondered even then a little
why she should wish not to show it and that with reflection with
suspicion might of course have made me uneasy
but it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection
with anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl the
vision of whose angelic beauty had probably more than anything else to
do with the restlessness that before morning made me several times
rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and
prospect to watch from my open window the faint summer dawn to look
at such portions of the rest of the house as i could catch and to
listen while in the fading dusk the first birds began to twitter
for the possible recurrence of a sound or two less natural and not
without but within that i had fancied i heard there had been a
moment when i believed i recognized faint and far the cry of a child
there had been another when i found myself just consciously starting as
at the passage before my door of a light footstep but these fancies
were not marked enough not to be thrown off and it is only in the
light or the gloom i should rather say of other and subsequent
matters that they now come back to me to watch teach form little
flora would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful life it
had been agreed between us downstairs that after this first occasion i
should have her as a matter of course at night her small white bed
being already arranged to that end in my room what i had undertaken
was the whole care of her and she had remained just this last time
with mrs grose only as an effect of our consideration for my
inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity in spite of this
timidity which the child herself in the oddest way in the world had
been perfectly frank and brave about allowing it without a sign of
uncomfortable consciousness with the deep sweet serenity indeed of
one of raphael s holy infants to be discussed to be imputed to her
and to determine us i feel quite sure she would presently like me it
was part of what i already liked mrs grose herself for the pleasure i
could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as i sat at supper with
four tall candles and with my pupil in a high chair and a bib
brightly facing me between them over bread and milk there were
naturally things that in flora s presence could pass between us only as
prodigious and gratified looks obscure and roundabout allusions
and the little boy does he look like her is he too so very
remarkable
one wouldn t flatter a child oh miss _most_ remarkable if you
think well of this one and she stood there with a plate in her hand
beaming at our companion who looked from one of us to the other with
placid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us
yes if i do
you _will_ be carried away by the little gentleman
well that i think is what i came for to be carried away i m
afraid however i remember feeling the impulse to add i m rather
easily carried away i was carried away in london
i can still see mrs grose s broad face as she took this in in harley
street
in harley street
well miss you re not the first and you won t be the last
oh i ve no pretension i could laugh to being the only one my
other pupil at any rate as i understand comes back tomorrow
not tomorrow friday miss he arrives as you did by the coach under
care of the guard and is to be met by the same carriage
i forthwith expressed that the proper as well as the pleasant and
friendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public
conveyance i should be in waiting for him with his little sister an
idea in which mrs grose concurred so heartily that i somehow took her
manner as a kind of comforting pledge never falsified thank
heaven that we should on every question be quite at one oh she was
glad i was there
what i felt the next day was i suppose nothing that could be fairly
called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival it was probably at the
most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the
scale as i walked round them gazed up at them took them in of my
new circumstances they had as it were an extent and mass for which i
had not been prepared and in the presence of which i found myself
freshly a little scared as well as a little proud lessons in this
agitation certainly suffered some delay i reflected that my first
duty was by the gentlest arts i could contrive to win the child into
the sense of knowing me i spent the day with her out of doors i
arranged with her to her great satisfaction that it should be she
she only who might show me the place she showed it step by step and
room by room and secret by secret with droll delightful childish
talk about it and with the result in half an hour of our becoming
immense friends young as she was i was struck throughout our little
tour with her confidence and courage with the way in empty chambers
and dull corridors on crooked staircases that made me pause and even
on the summit of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy
her morning music her disposition to tell me so many more things than
she asked rang out and led me on i have not seen bly since the day i
left it and i daresay that to my older and more informed eyes it would
now appear sufficiently contracted but as my little conductress with
her hair of gold and her frock of blue danced before me round corners
and pattered down passages i had the view of a castle of romance
inhabited by a rosy sprite such a place as would somehow for
diversion of the young idea take all color out of storybooks and
fairytales wasn t it just a storybook over which i had fallen adoze
and adream no it was a big ugly antique but convenient house
embodying a few features of a building still older half replaced and
half utilized in which i had the fancy of our being almost as lost as
a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship well i was
strangely at the helm
ii
this came home to me when two days later i drove over with flora to
meet as mrs grose said the little gentleman and all the more for an
incident that presenting itself the second evening had deeply
disconcerted me the first day had been on the whole as i have
expressed reassuring but i was to see it wind up in keen
apprehension the postbag that evening it came late contained a letter
for me which however in the hand of my employer i found to be
composed but of a few words enclosing another addressed to himself
with a seal still unbroken this i recognize is from the headmaster
and the headmaster s an awful bore read him please deal with him
but mind you don t report not a word i m off i broke the seal with
a great effort so great a one that i was a long time coming to it took
the unopened missive at last up to my room and only attacked it just
before going to bed i had better have let it wait till morning for it
gave me a second sleepless night with no counsel to take the next
day i was full of distress and it finally got so the better of me
that i determined to open myself at least to mrs grose
what does it mean the child s dismissed his school
she gave me a look that i remarked at the moment then visibly with a
quick blankness seemed to try to take it back but aren t they all
sent home yes but only for the holidays miles may never go back at
all
consciously under my attention she reddened they won t take him
they absolutely decline
at this she raised her eyes which she had turned from me i saw them
fill with good tears what has he done
i hesitated then i judged best simply to hand her my letter which
however had the effect of making her without taking it simply put
her hands behind her she shook her head sadly such things are not
for me miss
my counselor couldn t read i winced at my mistake which i attenuated
as i could and opened my letter again to repeat it to her then
faltering in the act and folding it up once more i put it back in my
pocket is he really _bad_
the tears were still in her eyes do the gentlemen say so
they go into no particulars they simply express their regret that it
should be impossible to keep him that can have only one meaning mrs
grose listened with dumb emotion she forbore to ask me what this
meaning might be so that presently to put the thing with some
coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind i went
on that he s an injury to the others
at this with one of the quick turns of simple folk she suddenly
flamed up master miles _him_ an injury
there was such a flood of good faith in it that though i had not yet
seen the child my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the
idea i found myself to meet my friend the better offering it on the
spot sarcastically to his poor little innocent mates
it s too dreadful cried mrs grose to say such cruel things why
he s scarce ten years old
yes yes it would be incredible
she was evidently grateful for such a profession see him miss
first _then_ believe it i felt forthwith a new impatience to see
him it was the beginning of a curiosity that for all the next hours
was to deepen almost to pain mrs grose was aware i could judge of
what she had produced in me and she followed it up with assurance
you might as well believe it of the little lady bless her she added
the next moment _look_ at her
i turned and saw that flora whom ten minutes before i had
established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper a pencil
and a copy of nice round o s now presented herself to view at the
open door she expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment
from disagreeable duties looking to me however with a great childish
light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had
conceived for my person which had rendered necessary that she should
follow me i needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of
mrs grose s comparison and catching my pupil in my arms covered her
with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement
nonetheless the rest of the day i watched for further occasion to
approach my colleague especially as toward evening i began to fancy
she rather sought to avoid me i overtook her i remember on the
staircase we went down together and at the bottom i detained her
holding her there with a hand on her arm i take what you said to me
at noon as a declaration that _you ve_ never known him to be bad
she threw back her head she had clearly by this time and very
honestly adopted an attitude oh never known him i don t pretend
_that _
i was upset again then you _have_ known him
yes indeed miss thank god
on reflection i accepted this you mean that a boy who never is
is no boy for _me _
i held her tighter you like them with the spirit to be naughty
then keeping pace with her answer so do i i eagerly brought out
but not to the degree to contaminate
to contaminate my big word left her at a loss i explained it to
corrupt
she stared taking my meaning in but it produced in her an odd laugh
are you afraid he ll corrupt _you _ she put the question with such a
fine bold humor that with a laugh a little silly doubtless to match
her own i gave way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule
but the next day as the hour for my drive approached i cropped up in
another place what was the lady who was here before
the last governess she was also young and pretty almost as young and
almost as pretty miss even as you
ah then i hope her youth and her beauty helped her i recollect
throwing off he seems to like us young and pretty
oh he _did_ mrs grose assented it was the way he liked
everyone she had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up
i mean that s _his_ way the master s
i was struck but of whom did you speak first
she looked blank but she colored why of _him_
of the master
of who else
there was so obviously no one else that the next moment i had lost my
impression of her having accidentally said more than she meant and i
merely asked what i wanted to know did _she_ see anything in the
boy
that wasn t right she never told me
i had a scruple but i overcame it was she careful particular
mrs grose appeared to try to be conscientious about some
things yes
but not about all
again she considered well miss she s gone i won t tell tales
i quite understand your feeling i hastened to reply but i thought
it after an instant not opposed to this concession to pursue did
she die here
no she went off
i don t know what there was in this brevity of mrs grose s that struck
me as ambiguous went off to die mrs grose looked straight out of
the window but i felt that hypothetically i had a right to know what
young persons engaged for bly were expected to do she was taken ill
you mean and went home
she was not taken ill so far as appeared in this house she left it
at the end of the year to go home as she said for a short holiday
to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right we
had then a young woman a nursemaid who had stayed on and who was a good
girl and clever and _she_ took the children altogether for the
interval but our young lady never came back and at the very moment i
was expecting her i heard from the master that she was dead
i turned this over but of what
he never told me but please miss said mrs grose i must get to
my work
iii
her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not for my just
preoccupations a snub that could check the growth of our mutual
esteem we met after i had brought home little miles more intimately
than ever on the ground of my stupefaction my general emotion so
monstrous was i then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now
been revealed to me should be under an interdict i was a little late
on the scene and i felt as he stood wistfully looking out for me
before the door of the inn at which the coach had put him down that i
had seen him on the instant without and within in the great glow of
freshness the same positive fragrance of purity in which i had from
the first moment seen his little sister he was incredibly beautiful
and mrs grose had put her finger on it everything but a sort of
passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence what i
then and there took him to my heart for was something divine that i
have never found to the same degree in any child his indescribable
little air of knowing nothing in the world but love it would have been
impossible to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence
and by the time i had got back to bly with him i remained merely
bewildered so far that is as i was not outraged by the sense of the
horrible letter locked up in my room in a drawer as soon as i could
compass a private word with mrs grose i declared to her that it was
grotesque
she promptly understood me you mean the cruel charge
it doesn t live an instant my dear woman _look_ at him
she smiled at my pretention to have discovered his charm i assure
you miss i do nothing else what will you say then she immediately
added
in answer to the letter i had made up my mind nothing
and to his uncle
i was incisive nothing
and to the boy himself
i was wonderful nothing
she gave with her apron a great wipe to her mouth then i ll stand by
you we ll see it out
we ll see it out i ardently echoed giving her my hand to make it a
vow
she held me there a moment then whisked up her apron again with her
detached hand would you mind miss if i used the freedom
to kiss me no i took the good creature in my arms and after we had
embraced like sisters felt still more fortified and indignant
this at all events was for the time a time so full that as i recall
the way it went it reminds me of all the art i now need to make it a
little distinct what i look back at with amazement is the situation i
accepted i had undertaken with my companion to see it out and i was
under a charm apparently that could smooth away the extent and the
far and difficult connections of such an effort i was lifted aloft on
a great wave of infatuation and pity i found it simple in my
ignorance my confusion and perhaps my conceit to assume that i could
deal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of
beginning i am unable even to remember at this day what proposal i
framed for the end of his holidays and the resumption of his studies
lessons with me indeed that charming summer we all had a theory that
he was to have but i now feel that for weeks the lessons must have
been rather my own i learned something at first certainly that had
not been one of the teachings of my small smothered life learned to
be amused and even amusing and not to think for the morrow it was
the first time in a manner that i had known space and air and
freedom all the music of summer and all the mystery of nature and
then there was consideration and consideration was sweet oh it was a
trap not designed but deep to my imagination to my delicacy perhaps
to my vanity to whatever in me was most excitable the best way to
picture it all is to say that i was off my guard they gave me so
little trouble they were of a gentleness so extraordinary i used to
speculate but even this with a dim disconnectedness as to how the rough
future for all futures are rough would handle them and might bruise
them they had the bloom of health and happiness and yet as if i had
been in charge of a pair of little grandees of princes of the blood
for whom everything to be right would have to be enclosed and
protected the only form that in my fancy the afteryears could take
for them was that of a romantic a really royal extension of the garden
and the park it may be of course above all that what suddenly broke
into this gives the previous time a charm of stillness that hush in
which something gathers or crouches the change was actually like the
spring of a beast
in the first weeks the days were long they often at their finest
gave me what i used to call my own hour the hour when for my pupils
teatime and bedtime having come and gone i had before my final
retirement a small interval alone much as i liked my companions this
hour was the thing in the day i liked most and i liked it best of all
when as the light faded or rather i should say the day lingered and
the last calls of the last birds sounded in a flushed sky from the
old trees i could take a turn into the grounds and enjoy almost with a
sense of property that amused and flattered me the beauty and dignity
of the place it was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself
tranquil and justified doubtless perhaps also to reflect that by my
discretion my quiet good sense and general high propriety i was
giving pleasure if he ever thought of it to the person to whose
pressure i had responded what i was doing was what he had earnestly
hoped and directly asked of me and that i _could_ after all do it
proved even a greater joy than i had expected i daresay i fancied
myself in short a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the
faith that this would more publicly appear well i needed to be
remarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently
gave their first sign
it was plump one afternoon in the middle of my very hour the
children were tucked away and i had come out for my stroll one of the
thoughts that as i don t in the least shrink now from noting used to
be with me in these wanderings was that it would be as charming as a
charming story suddenly to meet someone someone would appear there at
the turn of a path and would stand before me and smile and approve i
didn t ask more than that i only asked that he should _know _ and the
only way to be sure he knew would be to see it and the kind light of
it in his handsome face that was exactly present to me by which i
mean the face was when on the first of these occasions at the end of
a long june day i stopped short on emerging from one of the
plantations and coming into view of the house what arrested me on the
spot and with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed for was
the sense that my imagination had in a flash turned real he did
stand there but high up beyond the lawn and at the very top of the
tower to which on that first morning little flora had conducted me
this tower was one of a pair square incongruous crenelated
structures that were distinguished for some reason though i could see
little difference as the new and the old they flanked opposite ends
of the house and were probably architectural absurdities redeemed in a
measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too
pretentious dating in their gingerbread antiquity from a romantic
revival that was already a respectable past i admired them had
fancies about them for we could all profit in a degree especially
when they loomed through the dusk by the grandeur of their actual
battlements yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure i had
so often invoked seemed most in place
it produced in me this figure in the clear twilight i remember two
distinct gasps of emotion which were sharply the shock of my first
and that of my second surprise my second was a violent perception of
the mistake of my first the man who met my eyes was not the person i
had precipitately supposed there came to me thus a bewilderment of
vision of which after these years there is no living view that i can
hope to give an unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted object of
fear to a young woman privately bred and the figure that faced me
was a few more seconds assured me as little anyone else i knew as it
was the image that had been in my mind i had not seen it in harley
street i had not seen it anywhere the place moreover in the
strangest way in the world had on the instant and by the very fact
of its appearance become a solitude to me at least making my
statement here with a deliberation with which i have never made it the
whole feeling of the moment returns it was as if while i took in what
i did take in all the rest of the scene had been stricken with death i
can hear again as i write the intense hush in which the sounds of
evening dropped the rooks stopped cawing in the golden sky and the
friendly hour lost for the minute all its voice but there was no
other change in nature unless indeed it were a change that i saw with
a stranger sharpness the gold was still in the sky the clearness in
the air and the man who looked at me over the battlements was as
definite as a picture in a frame that s how i thought with
extraordinary quickness of each person that he might have been and
that he was not we were confronted across our distance quite long
enough for me to ask myself with intensity who then he was and to feel
as an effect of my inability to say a wonder that in a few instants
more became intense
the great question or one of these is afterward i know with regard
to certain matters the question of how long they have lasted well
this matter of mine think what you will of it lasted while i caught
at a dozen possibilities none of which made a difference for the
better that i could see in there having been in the house and for how
long above all a person of whom i was in ignorance it lasted while i
just bridled a little with the sense that my office demanded that there
should be no such ignorance and no such person it lasted while this
visitant at all events and there was a touch of the strange freedom
as i remember in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat seemed
to fix me from his position with just the question just the scrutiny
through the fading light that his own presence provoked we were too
far apart to call to each other but there was a moment at which at
shorter range some challenge between us breaking the hush would have
been the right result of our straight mutual stare he was in one of
the angles the one away from the house very erect as it struck me
and with both hands on the ledge so i saw him as i see the letters i
form on this page then exactly after a minute as if to add to the
spectacle he slowly changed his place passed looking at me hard all
the while to the opposite corner of the platform yes i had the
sharpest sense that during this transit he never took his eyes from me
and i can see at this moment the way his hand as he went passed from
one of the crenelations to the next he stopped at the other corner
but less long and even as he turned away still markedly fixed me he
turned away that was all i knew
iv
it was not that i didn t wait on this occasion for more for i was
rooted as deeply as i was shaken was there a secret at bly a mystery
of udolpho or an insane an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected
confinement i can t say how long i turned it over or how long in a
confusion of curiosity and dread i remained where i had had my
collision i only recall that when i re entered the house darkness had
quite closed in agitation in the interval certainly had held me and
driven me for i must in circling about the place have walked three
miles but i was to be later on so much more overwhelmed that this
mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill the most singular
part of it in fact singular as the rest had been was the part i
became in the hall aware of in meeting mrs grose this picture comes
back to me in the general train the impression as i received it on my
return of the wide white panelled space bright in the lamplight and
with its portraits and red carpet and of the good surprised look of my
friend which immediately told me she had missed me it came to me
straightway under her contact that with plain heartiness mere
relieved anxiety at my appearance she knew nothing whatever that could
bear upon the incident i had there ready for her i had not suspected
in advance that her comfortable face would pull me up and i somehow
measured the importance of what i had seen by my thus finding myself
hesitate to mention it scarce anything in the whole history seems to
me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one as i may
say with the instinct of sparing my companion on the spot
accordingly in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me i for a
reason that i couldn t then have phrased achieved an inward
resolution offered a vague pretext for my lateness and with the plea
of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet went as
soon as possible to my room
here it was another affair here for many days after it was a queer
affair enough there were hours from day to day or at least there were
moments snatched even from clear duties when i had to shut myself up
to think it was not so much yet that i was more nervous than i could
bear to be as that i was remarkably afraid of becoming so for the
truth i had now to turn over was simply and clearly the truth that i
could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom i had been
so inexplicably and yet as it seemed to me so intimately concerned
it took little time to see that i could sound without forms of inquiry
and without exciting remark any domestic complications the shock i had
suffered must have sharpened all my senses i felt sure at the end of
three days and as the result of mere closer attention that i had not
been practiced upon by the servants nor made the object of any game
of whatever it was that i knew nothing was known around me there was
but one sane inference someone had taken a liberty rather gross that
was what repeatedly i dipped into my room and locked the door to say
to myself we had been collectively subject to an intrusion some
unscrupulous traveler curious in old houses had made his way in
unobserved enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view and then
stolen out as he came if he had given me such a bold hard stare that
was but a part of his indiscretion the good thing after all was that
we should surely see no more of him
this was not so good a thing i admit as not to leave me to judge that
what essentially made nothing else much signify was simply my
charming work my charming work was just my life with miles and flora
and through nothing could i so like it as through feeling that i could
throw myself into it in trouble the attraction of my small charges was
a constant joy leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my
original fears the distaste i had begun by entertaining for the
probable gray prose of my office there was to be no gray prose it
appeared and no long grind so how could work not be charming that
presented itself as daily beauty it was all the romance of the nursery
and the poetry of the schoolroom i don t mean by this of course that
we studied only fiction and verse i mean i can express no otherwise
the sort of interest my companions inspired how can i describe that
except by saying that instead of growing used to them and it s a marvel
for a governess i call the sisterhood to witness i made constant
fresh discoveries there was one direction assuredly in which these
discoveries stopped deep obscurity continued to cover the region of
the boy s conduct at school it had been promptly given me i have
noted to face that mystery without a pang perhaps even it would be
nearer the truth to say that without a word he himself had cleared it
up he had made the whole charge absurd my conclusion bloomed there
with the real rose flush of his innocence he was only too fine and
fair for the little horrid unclean school world and he had paid a
price for it i reflected acutely that the sense of such differences
such superiorities of quality always on the part of the
majority which could include even stupid sordid headmasters turn
infallibly to the vindictive
both the children had a gentleness it was their only fault and it
never made miles a muff that kept them how shall i express it almost
impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable they were like the cherubs
of the anecdote who had morally at any rate nothing to whack i
remember feeling with miles in especial as if he had had as it were
no history we expect of a small child a scant one but there was in
this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive yet
extraordinarily happy that more than in any creature of his age i
have seen struck me as beginning anew each day he had never for a
second suffered i took this as a direct disproof of his having really
been chastised if he had been wicked he would have caught it and i
should have caught it by the rebound i should have found the trace i
found nothing at all and he was therefore an angel he never spoke of
his school never mentioned a comrade or a master and i for my part
was quite too much disgusted to allude to them of course i was under
the spell and the wonderful part is that even at the time i
perfectly knew i was but i gave myself up to it it was an antidote to
any pain and i had more pains than one i was in receipt in these days
of disturbing letters from home where things were not going well but
with my children what things in the world mattered that was the
question i used to put to my scrappy retirements i was dazzled by
their loveliness
there was a sunday to get on when it rained with such force and for so
many hours that there could be no procession to church in consequence
of which as the day declined i had arranged with mrs grose that
should the evening show improvement we would attend together the late
service the rain happily stopped and i prepared for our walk which
through the park and by the good road to the village would be a matter
of twenty minutes coming downstairs to meet my colleague in the hall
i remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and that
had received them with a publicity perhaps not edifying while i sat
with the children at their tea served on sundays by exception in
that cold clean temple of mahogany and brass the grown up dining
room the gloves had been dropped there and i turned in to recover
them the day was gray enough but the afternoon light still lingered
and it enabled me on crossing the threshold not only to recognize on
a chair near the wide window then closed the articles i wanted but
to become aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking
straight in one step into the room had sufficed my vision was
instantaneous it was all there the person looking straight in was the
person who had already appeared to me he appeared thus again with i
won t say greater distinctness for that was impossible but with a
nearness that represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made
me as i met him catch my breath and turn cold he was the same he was
the same and seen this time as he had been seen before from the
waist up the window though the dining room was on the ground floor
not going down to the terrace on which he stood his face was close to
the glass yet the effect of this better view was strangely only to
show me how intense the former had been he remained but a few
seconds long enough to convince me he also saw and recognized but it
was as if i had been looking at him for years and had known him always
something however happened this time that had not happened before
his stare into my face through the glass and across the room was as
deep and hard as then but it quitted me for a moment during which i
could still watch it see it fix successively several other things on
the spot there came to me the added shock of a certitude that it was
not for me he had come there he had come for someone else
the flash of this knowledge for it was knowledge in the midst of
dread produced in me the most extraordinary effect started as i stood
there a sudden vibration of duty and courage i say courage because i
was beyond all doubt already far gone i bounded straight out of the
door again reached that of the house got in an instant upon the
drive and passing along the terrace as fast as i could rush turned a
corner and came full in sight but it was in sight of nothing now my
visitor had vanished i stopped i almost dropped with the real relief
of this but i took in the whole scene i gave him time to reappear i
call it time but how long was it i can t speak to the purpose today
of the duration of these things that kind of measure must have left
me they couldn t have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last
the terrace and the whole place the lawn and the garden beyond it all
i could see of the park were empty with a great emptiness there were
shrubberies and big trees but i remember the clear assurance i felt
that none of them concealed him he was there or was not there not
there if i didn t see him i got hold of this then instinctively
instead of returning as i had come went to the window it was
confusedly present to me that i ought to place myself where he had
stood i did so i applied my face to the pane and looked as he had
looked into the room as if at this moment to show me exactly what
his range had been mrs grose as i had done for himself just before
came in from the hall with this i had the full image of a repetition
of what had already occurred she saw me as i had seen my own visitant
she pulled up short as i had done i gave her something of the shock
that i had received she turned white and this made me ask myself if i
had blanched as much she stared in short and retreated on just _my_
lines and i knew she had then passed out and come round to me and that
i should presently meet her i remained where i was and while i waited
i thought of more things than one but there s only one i take space to
mention i wondered why _she_ should be scared
v
oh she let me know as soon as round the corner of the house she
loomed again into view what in the name of goodness is the matter
she was now flushed and out of breath
i said nothing till she came quite near with me i must have made a
wonderful face do i show it
you re as white as a sheet you look awful
i considered i could meet on this without scruple any innocence my
need to respect the bloom of mrs grose s had dropped without a
rustle from my shoulders and if i wavered for the instant it was not
with what i kept back i put out my hand to her and she took it i held
her hard a little liking to feel her close to me there was a kind of
support in the shy heave of her surprise you came for me for church
of course but i can t go
has anything happened
yes you must know now did i look very queer
through this window dreadful
well i said i ve been frightened mrs grose s eyes expressed
plainly that _she_ had no wish to be yet also that she knew too well
her place not to be ready to share with me any marked inconvenience
oh it was quite settled that she _must_ share just what you saw from
the dining room a minute ago was the effect of that what _i_ saw just
before was much worse
her hand tightened what was it
an extraordinary man looking in
what extraordinary man
i haven t the least idea
mrs grose gazed round us in vain then where is he gone
i know still less
have you seen him before
yes once on the old tower
she could only look at me harder do you mean he s a stranger
oh very much
yet you didn t tell me
no for reasons but now that you ve guessed
mrs grose s round eyes encountered this charge ah i haven t
guessed she said very simply how can i if _you_ don t imagine
i don t in the very least
you ve seen him nowhere but on the tower
and on this spot just now
mrs grose looked round again what was he doing on the tower
only standing there and looking down at me
she thought a minute was he a gentleman
i found i had no need to think no she gazed in deeper wonder no
then nobody about the place nobody from the village
nobody nobody i didn t tell you but i made sure
she breathed a vague relief this was oddly so much to the good it
only went indeed a little way but if he isn t a gentleman
what _is_ he he s a horror
a horror
he s god help me if i know _what_ he is
mrs grose looked round once more she fixed her eyes on the duskier
distance then pulling herself together turned to me with abrupt
inconsequence it s time we should be at church
oh i m not fit for church
won t it do you good
it won t do _them _ i nodded at the house
the children
i can t leave them now
you re afraid
i spoke boldly i m afraid of _him_
mrs grose s large face showed me at this for the first time the
faraway faint glimmer of a consciousness more acute i somehow made out
in it the delayed dawn of an idea i myself had not given her and that
was as yet quite obscure to me it comes back to me that i thought
instantly of this as something i could get from her and i felt it to
be connected with the desire she presently showed to know more when
was it on the tower
about the middle of the month at this same hour
almost at dark said mrs grose
oh no not nearly i saw him as i see you
then how did he get in
and how did he get out i laughed i had no opportunity to ask him
this evening you see i pursued he has not been able to get in
he only peeps
i hope it will be confined to that she had now let go my hand she
turned away a little i waited an instant then i brought out go to
church goodbye i must watch
slowly she faced me again do you fear for them
we met in another long look don t _you _ instead of answering she
came nearer to the window and for a minute applied her face to the
glass you see how he could see i meanwhile went on
she didn t move how long was he here
till i came out i came to meet him
mrs grose at last turned round and there was still more in her face
_i_ couldn t have come out
neither could i i laughed again but i did come i have my duty
so have i mine she replied after which she added what is he
like
i ve been dying to tell you but he s like nobody
nobody she echoed
he has no hat then seeing in her face that she already in this
with a deeper dismay found a touch of picture i quickly added stroke
to stroke he has red hair very red close curling and a pale face
long in shape with straight good features and little rather queer
whiskers that are as red as his hair his eyebrows are somehow
darker they look particularly arched and as if they might move a good
deal his eyes are sharp strange awfully but i only know clearly that
they re rather small and very fixed his mouth s wide and his lips are
thin and except for his little whiskers he s quite clean shaven he
gives me a sort of sense of looking like an actor
an actor it was impossible to resemble one less at least than mrs
grose at that moment
i ve never seen one but so i suppose them he s tall active erect
i continued but never no never a gentleman
my companion s face had blanched as i went on her round eyes started
and her mild mouth gaped a gentleman she gasped confounded
stupefied a gentleman _he _
you know him then
she visibly tried to hold herself but he _is_ handsome
i saw the way to help her remarkably
and dressed
in somebody s clothes they re smart but they re not his own
she broke into a breathless affirmative groan they re the master s
i caught it up you _do_ know him
she faltered but a second quint she cried
quint
peter quint his own man his valet when he was here
when the master was
gaping still but meeting me she pieced it all together he never
wore his hat but he did wear well there were waistcoats missed they
were both here last year then the master went and quint was alone
i followed but halting a little alone
alone with _us_ then as from a deeper depth in charge she
added
and what became of him
she hung fire so long that i was still more mystified he went too
she brought out at last
went where
her expression at this became extraordinary god knows where he
died
died i almost shrieked
she seemed fairly to square herself plant herself more firmly to utter
the wonder of it yes mr quint is dead
vi
it took of course more than that particular passage to place us
together in presence of what we had now to live with as we could my
dreadful liability to impressions of the order so vividly exemplified
and my companion s knowledge henceforth a knowledge half consternation
and half compassion of that liability there had been this evening
after the revelation left me for an hour so prostrate there had been
for either of us no attendance on any service but a little service of
tears and vows of prayers and promises a climax to the series of
mutual challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our
retreating together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there
to have everything out the result of our having everything out was
simply to reduce our situation to the last rigor of its elements she
herself had seen nothing not the shadow of a shadow and nobody in the
house but the governess was in the governess s plight yet she accepted
without directly impugning my sanity the truth as i gave it to her and
ended by showing me on this ground an awestricken tenderness an
expression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege of
which the very breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of
human charities
what was settled between us accordingly that night was that we
thought we might bear things together and i was not even sure that in
spite of her exemption it was she who had the best of the burden i
knew at this hour i think as well as i knew later what i was capable
of meeting to shelter my pupils but it took me some time to be wholly
sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so
compromising a contract i was queer company enough quite as queer as
the company i received but as i trace over what we went through i see
how much common ground we must have found in the one idea that by good
fortune _could_ steady us it was the idea the second movement that
led me straight out as i may say of the inner chamber of my dread i
could take the air in the court at least and there mrs grose could
join me perfectly can i recall now the particular way strength came to
me before we separated for the night we had gone over and over every
feature of what i had seen
he was looking for someone else you say someone who was not you
he was looking for little miles a portentous clearness now possessed
me _that s_ whom he was looking for
but how do you know
i know i know i know my exaltation grew and _you_ know my
dear
she didn t deny this but i required i felt not even so much telling
as that she resumed in a moment at any rate what if _he_ should see
him
little miles that s what he wants
she looked immensely scared again the child
heaven forbid the man he wants to appear to _them_ that he might
was an awful conception and yet somehow i could keep it at bay
which moreover as we lingered there was what i succeeded in
practically proving i had an absolute certainty that i should see
again what i had already seen but something within me said that by
offering myself bravely as the sole subject of such experience by
accepting by inviting by surmounting it all i should serve as an
expiatory victim and guard the tranquility of my companions the
children in especial i should thus fence about and absolutely save i
recall one of the last things i said that night to mrs grose
it does strike me that my pupils have never mentioned
she looked at me hard as i musingly pulled up his having been here
and the time they were with him
the time they were with him and his name his presence his history
in any way
oh the little lady doesn t remember she never heard or knew
the circumstances of his death i thought with some intensity
perhaps not but miles would remember miles would know
ah don t try him broke from mrs grose
i returned her the look she had given me don t be afraid i
continued to think it _is_ rather odd
that he has never spoken of him
never by the least allusion and you tell me they were great
friends
oh it wasn t _him _ mrs grose with emphasis declared it was
quint s own fancy to play with him i mean to spoil him she paused a
moment then she added quint was much too free
this gave me straight from my vision of his face _such_ a face a
sudden sickness of disgust too free with _my_ boy
too free with everyone
i forbore for the moment to analyze this description further than by
the reflection that a part of it applied to several of the members of
the household of the half dozen maids and men who were still of our
small colony but there was everything for our apprehension in the
lucky fact that no discomfortable legend no perturbation of scullions
had ever within anyone s memory attached to the kind old place it had
neither bad name nor ill fame and mrs grose most apparently only
desired to cling to me and to quake in silence i even put her the
very last thing of all to the test it was when at midnight she had
her hand on the schoolroom door to take leave i have it from you
then for it s of great importance that he was definitely and admittedly
bad
oh not admittedly _i_ knew it but the master didn t
and you never told him
well he didn t like tale bearing he hated complaints he was terribly
short with anything of that kind and if people were all right to
_him_
he wouldn t be bothered with more this squared well enough with my
impressions of him he was not a trouble loving gentleman nor so very
particular perhaps about some of the company _he_ kept all the same i
pressed my interlocutress i promise you _i_ would have told
she felt my discrimination i daresay i was wrong but really i was
afraid
afraid of what
of things that man could do quint was so clever he was so deep
i took this in still more than probably i showed you weren t afraid
of anything else not of his effect
his effect she repeated with a face of anguish and waiting while i
faltered
on innocent little precious lives they were in your charge
no they were not in mine she roundly and distressfully returned
the master believed in him and placed him here because he was supposed
not to be well and the country air so good for him so he had
everything to say yes she let me have it even about _them_
them that creature i had to smother a kind of howl and you could
bear it
no i couldn t and i can t now and the poor woman burst into tears
a rigid control from the next day was as i have said to follow
them yet how often and how passionately for a week we came back
together to the subject much as we had discussed it that sunday night
i was in the immediate later hours in especial for it may be imagined
whether i slept still haunted with the shadow of something she had not
told me i myself had kept back nothing but there was a word mrs
grose had kept back i was sure moreover by morning that this was
not from a failure of frankness but because on every side there were
fears it seems to me indeed in retrospect that by the time the
morrow s sun was high i had restlessly read into the fact before us
almost all the meaning they were to receive from subsequent and more
cruel occurrences what they gave me above all was just the sinister
figure of the living man the dead one would keep awhile and of the
months he had continuously passed at bly which added up made a
formidable stretch the limit of this evil time had arrived only when
on the dawn of a winter s morning peter quint was found by a laborer
going to early work stone dead on the road from the village a
catastrophe explained superficially at least by a visible wound to his
head such a wound as might have been produced and as on the final
evidence _had_ been by a fatal slip in the dark and after leaving the
public house on the steepish icy slope a wrong path altogether at
the bottom of which he lay the icy slope the turn mistaken at night
and in liquor accounted for much practically in the end and after the
inquest and boundless chatter for everything but there had been
matters in his life strange passages and perils secret disorders
vices more than suspected that would have accounted for a good deal
more
i scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible
picture of my state of mind but i was in these days literally able to
find a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demanded
of me i now saw that i had been asked for a service admirable and
difficult and there would be a greatness in letting it be seen oh in
the right quarter that i could succeed where many another girl might
have failed it was an immense help to me i confess i rather applaud
myself as i look back that i saw my service so strongly and so simply
i was there to protect and defend the little creatures in the world the
most bereaved and the most lovable the appeal of whose helplessness
had suddenly become only too explicit a deep constant ache of one s
own committed heart we were cut off really together we were united
in our danger they had nothing but me and i well i had _them_ it
was in short a magnificent chance this chance presented itself to me
in an image richly material i was a screen i was to stand before them
the more i saw the less they would i began to watch them in a stifled
suspense a disguised excitement that might well had it continued too
long have turned to something like madness what saved me as i now
see was that it turned to something else altogether it didn t last as
suspense it was superseded by horrible proofs proofs i say yes from
the moment i really took hold
this moment dated from an afternoon hour that i happened to spend in
the grounds with the younger of my pupils alone we had left miles
indoors on the red cushion of a deep window seat he had wished to
finish a book and i had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable
in a young man whose only defect was an occasional excess of the
restless his sister on the contrary had been alert to come out and
i strolled with her half an hour seeking the shade for the sun was
still high and the day exceptionally warm i was aware afresh with
her as we went of how like her brother she contrived it was the
charming thing in both children to let me alone without appearing to
drop me and to accompany me without appearing to surround they were
never importunate and yet never listless my attention to them all
really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely without me this
was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that engaged me as
an active admirer i walked in a world of their invention they had no
occasion whatever to draw upon mine so that my time was taken only
with being for them some remarkable person or thing that the game of
the moment required and that was merely thanks to my superior my
exalted stamp a happy and highly distinguished sinecure i forget what
i was on the present occasion i only remember that i was something
very important and very quiet and that flora was playing very hard we
were on the edge of the lake and as we had lately begun geography
the lake was the sea of azof
suddenly in these circumstances i became aware that on the other
side of the sea of azof we had an interested spectator the way this
knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in the world the
strangest that is except the very much stranger in which it quickly
merged itself i had sat down with a piece of work for i was something
or other that could sit on the old stone bench which overlooked the
pond and in this position i began to take in with certitude and yet
without direct vision the presence at a distance of a third person
the old trees the thick shrubbery made a great and pleasant shade
but it was all suffused with the brightness of the hot still hour
there was no ambiguity in anything none whatever at least in the
conviction i from one moment to another found myself forming as to what
i should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of
raising my eyes they were attached at this juncture to the stitching
in which i was engaged and i can feel once more the spasm of my effort
not to move them till i should so have steadied myself as to be able to
make up my mind what to do there was an alien object in view a figure
whose right of presence i instantly passionately questioned i
recollect counting over perfectly the possibilities reminding myself
that nothing was more natural for instance then the appearance of one
of the men about the place or even of a messenger a postman or a
tradesman s boy from the village that reminder had as little effect
on my practical certitude as i was conscious still even without
looking of its having upon the character and attitude of our visitor
nothing was more natural than that these things should be the other
things that they absolutely were not
of the positive identity of the apparition i would assure myself as
soon as the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right
second meanwhile with an effort that was already sharp enough i
transferred my eyes straight to little flora who at the moment was
about ten yards away my heart had stood still for an instant with the
wonder and terror of the question whether she too would see and i held
my breath while i waited for what a cry from her what some sudden
innocent sign either of interest or of alarm would tell me i waited
but nothing came then in the first place and there is something more
dire in this i feel than in anything i have to relate i was
determined by a sense that within a minute all sounds from her had
previously dropped and in the second by the circumstance that also
within the minute she had in her play turned her back to the water
this was her attitude when i at last looked at her looked with the
confirmed conviction that we were still together under direct
personal notice she had picked up a small flat piece of wood which
happened to have in it a little hole that had evidently suggested to
her the idea of sticking in another fragment that might figure as a
mast and make the thing a boat this second morsel as i watched her
she was very markedly and intently attempting to tighten in its place
my apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that after some
seconds i felt i was ready for more then i again shifted my eyes i
faced what i had to face
vii
i got hold of mrs grose as soon after this as i could and i can give
no intelligible account of how i fought out the interval yet i still
hear myself cry as i fairly threw myself into her arms they
_know_ it s too monstrous they know they know
and what on earth i felt her incredulity as she held me
why all that _we_ know and heaven knows what else besides then as
she released me i made it out to her made it out perhaps only now
with full coherency even to myself two hours ago in the garden i
could scarce articulate flora _saw _
mrs grose took it as she might have taken a blow in the stomach she
has told you she panted
not a word that s the horror she kept it to herself the child of
eight _that_ child unutterable still for me was the stupefaction
of it
mrs grose of course could only gape the wider then how do you
know
i was there i saw with my eyes saw that she was perfectly aware
do you mean aware of _him _
no of _her_ i was conscious as i spoke that i looked prodigious
things for i got the slow reflection of them in my companion s face
another person this time but a figure of quite as unmistakable horror
and evil a woman in black pale and dreadful with such an air also
and such a face on the other side of the lake i was there with the
child quiet for the hour and in the midst of it she came
came how from where
from where they come from she just appeared and stood there but not
so near
and without coming nearer
oh for the effect and the feeling she might have been as close as
you
my friend with an odd impulse fell back a step was she someone
you ve never seen
yes but someone the child has someone _you_ have then to show how
i had thought it all out my predecessor the one who died
miss jessel
miss jessel you don t believe me i pressed
she turned right and left in her distress how can you be sure
this drew from me in the state of my nerves a flash of impatience
then ask flora _she s_ sure but i had no sooner spoken than i caught
myself up no for god s sake _don t _ she ll say she isn t she ll
lie
mrs grose was not too bewildered instinctively to protest ah how
_can_ you
because i m clear flora doesn t want me to know
it s only then to spare you
no no there are depths depths the more i go over it the more i see
in it and the more i see in it the more i fear i don t know what i
_don t_ see what i _don t_ fear
mrs grose tried to keep up with me you mean you re afraid of seeing
her again
oh no that s nothing now then i explained it s of _not_ seeing
her
but my companion only looked wan i don t understand you
why it s that the child may keep it up and that the child assuredly
_will_ without my knowing it
at the image of this possibility mrs grose for a moment collapsed yet
presently to pull herself together again as if from the positive force
of the sense of what should we yield an inch there would really be to
give way to dear dear we must keep our heads and after all if she
doesn t mind it she even tried a grim joke perhaps she likes it
likes _such_ things a scrap of an infant
isn t it just a proof of her blessed innocence my friend bravely
inquired
she brought me for the instant almost round oh we must clutch at
_that_ we must cling to it if it isn t a proof of what you say it s a
proof of god knows what for the woman s a horror of horrors
mrs grose at this fixed her eyes a minute on the ground then at
last raising them tell me how you know she said
then you admit it s what she was i cried
tell me how you know my friend simply repeated
know by seeing her by the way she looked
at you do you mean so wickedly
dear me no i could have borne that she gave me never a glance she
only fixed the child
mrs grose tried to see it fixed her
ah with such awful eyes
she stared at mine as if they might really have resembled them do you
mean of dislike
god help us no of something much worse
worse than dislike this left her indeed at a loss
with a determination indescribable with a kind of fury of intention
i made her turn pale intention
to get hold of her mrs grose her eyes just lingering on mine gave a
shudder and walked to the window and while she stood there looking out
i completed my statement _that s_ what flora knows
after a little she turned round the person was in black you say
in mourning rather poor almost shabby but yes with extraordinary
beauty i now recognized to what i had at last stroke by stroke
brought the victim of my confidence for she quite visibly weighed
this oh handsome very very i insisted wonderfully handsome but
infamous
she slowly came back to me miss jessel _was_ infamous she once more
took my hand in both her own holding it as tight as if to fortify me
against the increase of alarm i might draw from this disclosure they
were both infamous she finally said
so for a little we faced it once more together and i found
absolutely a degree of help in seeing it now so straight i
appreciate i said the great decency of your not having hitherto
spoken but the time has certainly come to give me the whole thing
she appeared to assent to this but still only in silence seeing which
i went on i must have it now of what did she die come there was
something between them
there was everything
in spite of the difference
oh of their rank their condition she brought it woefully out
_she_ was a lady
i turned it over i again saw yes she was a lady
and he so dreadfully below said mrs grose
i felt that i doubtless needn t press too hard in such company on the
place of a servant in the scale but there was nothing to prevent an
acceptance of my companion s own measure of my predecessor s abasement
there was a way to deal with that and i dealt the more readily for my
full vision on the evidence of our employer s late clever good looking
own man impudent assured spoiled depraved the fellow was a
hound
mrs grose considered as if it were perhaps a little a case for a sense
of shades i ve never seen one like him he did what he wished
with _her _
with them all
it was as if now in my friend s own eyes miss jessel had again
appeared i seemed at any rate for an instant to see their evocation
of her as distinctly as i had seen her by the pond and i brought out
with decision it must have been also what _she_ wished
mrs grose s face signified that it had been indeed but she said at
the same time poor woman she paid for it
then you do know what she died of i asked
no i know nothing i wanted not to know i was glad enough i didn t
and i thanked heaven she was well out of this
yet you had then your idea
of her real reason for leaving oh yes as to that she couldn t have
stayed fancy it here for a governess and afterward i imagined and i
still imagine and what i imagine is dreadful
not so dreadful as what _i_ do i replied on which i must have shown
her as i was indeed but too conscious a front of miserable defeat it
brought out again all her compassion for me and at the renewed touch
of her kindness my power to resist broke down i burst as i had the
other time made her burst into tears she took me to her motherly
breast and my lamentation overflowed i don t do it i sobbed in
despair i don t save or shield them it s far worse than i
dreamed they re lost
viii
what i had said to mrs grose was true enough there were in the matter
i had put before her depths and possibilities that i lacked resolution
to sound so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of
a common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant fancies we
were to keep our heads if we should keep nothing else difficult indeed
as that might be in the face of what in our prodigious experience was
least to be questioned late that night while the house slept we had
another talk in my room when she went all the way with me as to its
being beyond doubt that i had seen exactly what i had seen to hold her
perfectly in the pinch of that i found i had only to ask her how if i
had made it up i came to be able to give of each of the persons
appearing to me a picture disclosing to the last detail their
special marks a portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly
recognized and named them she wished of course small blame to her to
sink the whole subject and i was quick to assure her that my own
interest in it had now violently taken the form of a search for the way
to escape from it i encountered her on the ground of a probability
that with recurrence for recurrence we took for granted i should get
used to my danger distinctly professing that my personal exposure had
suddenly become the least of my discomforts it was my new suspicion
that was intolerable and yet even to this complication the later hours
of the day had brought a little ease
on leaving her after my first outbreak i had of course returned to my
pupils associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of
their charm which i had already found to be a thing i could positively
cultivate and which had never failed me yet i had simply in other
words plunged afresh into flora s special society and there become
aware it was almost a luxury that she could put her little conscious
hand straight upon the spot that ached she had looked at me in sweet
speculation and then had accused me to my face of having cried i had
supposed i had brushed away the ugly signs but i could literally for
the time at all events rejoice under this fathomless charity that
they had not entirely disappeared to gaze into the depths of blue of
the child s eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature
cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which i
naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and so far as might be my
agitation i couldn t abjure for merely wanting to but i could repeat
to mrs grose as i did there over and over in the small hours that
with their voices in the air their pressure on one s heart and their
fragrant faces against one s cheek everything fell to the ground but
their incapacity and their beauty it was a pity that somehow to
settle this once for all i had equally to re enumerate the signs of
subtlety that in the afternoon by the lake had made a miracle of my
show of self possession it was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate
the certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as
a revelation that the inconceivable communion i then surprised was a
matter for either party of habit it was a pity that i should have
had to quaver out again the reasons for my not having in my delusion
so much as questioned that the little girl saw our visitant even as i
actually saw mrs grose herself and that she wanted by just so much
as she did thus see to make me suppose she didn t and at the same
time without showing anything arrive at a guess as to whether i
myself did it was a pity that i needed once more to describe the
portentous little activity by which she sought to divert my
attention the perceptible increase of movement the greater intensity
of play the singing the gabbling of nonsense and the invitation to
romp
yet if i had not indulged to prove there was nothing in it in this
review i should have missed the two or three dim elements of comfort
that still remained to me i should not for instance have been able to
asseverate to my friend that i was certain which was so much to the
good that _i_ at least had not betrayed myself i should not have been
prompted by stress of need by desperation of mind i scarce know what
to call it to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring
from pushing my colleague fairly to the wall she had told me bit by
bit under pressure a great deal but a small shifty spot on the wrong
side of it all still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat
and i remember how on this occasion for the sleeping house and the
concentration alike of our danger and our watch seemed to help i felt
the importance of giving the last jerk to the curtain i don t believe
anything so horrible i recollect saying no let us put it
definitely my dear that i don t but if i did you know there s a
thing i should require now just without sparing you the least bit
more oh not a scrap come to get out of you what was it you had in
mind when in our distress before miles came back over the letter
from his school you said under my insistence that you didn t pretend
for him that he had not literally _ever_ been bad he has _not_
literally ever in these weeks that i myself have lived with him and
so closely watched him he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of
delightful lovable goodness therefore you might perfectly have made
the claim for him if you had not as it happened seen an exception to
take what was your exception and to what passage in your personal
observation of him did you refer
it was a dreadfully austere inquiry but levity was not our note and
at any rate before the gray dawn admonished us to separate i had got
my answer what my friend had had in mind proved to be immensely to the
purpose it was neither more nor less than the circumstance that for a
period of several months quint and the boy had been perpetually
together it was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had
ventured to criticize the propriety to hint at the incongruity of so
close an alliance and even to go so far on the subject as a frank
overture to miss jessel miss jessel had with a most strange manner
requested her to mind her business and the good woman had on this
directly approached little miles what she had said to him since i
pressed was that _she_ liked to see young gentlemen not forget their
station
i pressed again of course at this you reminded him that quint was
only a base menial
as you might say and it was his answer for one thing that was bad
and for another thing i waited he repeated your words to quint
no not that it s just what he _wouldn t _ she could still impress
upon me i was sure at any rate she added that he didn t but he
denied certain occasions
what occasions
when they had been about together quite as if quint were his tutor and
a very grand one and miss jessel only for the little lady when he had
gone off with the fellow i mean and spent hours with him
he then prevaricated about it he said he hadn t her assent was clear
enough to cause me to add in a moment i see he lied
oh mrs grose mumbled this was a suggestion that it didn t matter
which indeed she backed up by a further remark you see after all
miss jessel didn t mind she didn t forbid him
i considered did he put that to you as a justification
at this she dropped again no he never spoke of it
never mentioned her in connection with quint
she saw visibly flushing where i was coming out well he didn t
show anything he denied she repeated he denied
lord how i pressed her now so that you could see he knew what was
between the two wretches
i don t know i don t know the poor woman groaned
you do know you dear thing i replied only you haven t my dreadful
boldness of mind and you keep back out of timidity and modesty and
delicacy even the impression that in the past when you had without
my aid to flounder about in silence most of all made you miserable
but i shall get it out of you yet there was something in the boy that
suggested to you i continued that he covered and concealed their
relation
oh he couldn t prevent
your learning the truth i daresay but heavens i fell with
vehemence athinking what it shows that they must to that extent
have succeeded in making of him
ah nothing that s not nice _now _ mrs grose lugubriously pleaded
i don t wonder you looked queer i persisted when i mentioned to
you the letter from his school
i doubt if i looked as queer as you she retorted with homely force
and if he was so bad then as that comes to how is he such an angel
now
yes indeed and if he was a fiend at school how how how well i
said in my torment you must put it to me again but i shall not be
able to tell you for some days only put it to me again i cried in a
way that made my friend stare there are directions in which i must
not for the present let myself go meanwhile i returned to her first
example the one to which she had just previously referred of the boy s
happy capacity for an occasional slip if quint on your remonstrance
at the time you speak of was a base menial one of the things miles
said to you i find myself guessing was that you were another again
her admission was so adequate that i continued and you forgave him
that
wouldn t _you _
oh yes and we exchanged there in the stillness a sound of the
oddest amusement then i went on at all events while he was with the
man
miss flora was with the woman it suited them all
it suited me too i felt only too well by which i mean that it
suited exactly the particularly deadly view i was in the very act of
forbidding myself to entertain but i so far succeeded in checking the
expression of this view that i will throw just here no further light
on it than may be offered by the mention of my final observation to
mrs grose his having lied and been impudent are i confess less
engaging specimens than i had hoped to have from you of the outbreak in
him of the little natural man still i mused they must do for they
make me feel more than ever that i must watch
it made me blush the next minute to see in my friend s face how much
more unreservedly she had forgiven him than her anecdote struck me as
presenting to my own tenderness an occasion for doing this came out
when at the schoolroom door she quitted me surely you don t accuse
_him_
of carrying on an intercourse that he conceals from me ah remember
that until further evidence i now accuse nobody then before
shutting her out to go by another passage to her own place i must
just wait i wound up
ix
i waited and waited and the days as they elapsed took something from
my consternation a very few of them in fact passing in constant
sight of my pupils without a fresh incident sufficed to give to
grievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the
sponge i have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish
grace as a thing i could actively cultivate and it may be imagined if
i neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it would
yield stranger than i can express certainly was the effort to
struggle against my new lights it would doubtless have been however
a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful i
used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that i thought
strange things about them and the circumstances that these things only
made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping
them in the dark i trembled lest they should see that they _were_ so
immensely more interesting putting things at the worst at all events
as in meditation i so often did any clouding of their innocence could
only be blameless and foredoomed as they were a reason the more for
taking risks there were moments when by an irresistible impulse i
found myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart as soon as
i had done so i used to say to myself what will they think of that
doesn t it betray too much it would have been easy to get into a sad
wild tangle about how much i might betray but the real account i
feel of the hours of peace that i could still enjoy was that the
immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective even
under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied for if it
occurred to me that i might occasionally excite suspicion by the little
outbreaks of my sharper passion for them so too i remember wondering
if i mightn t see a queerness in the traceable increase of their own
demonstrations
they were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me
which after all i could reflect was no more than a graceful response
in children perpetually bowed over and hugged the homage of which they
were so lavish succeeded in truth for my nerves quite as well as if
i never appeared to myself as i may say literally to catch them at a
purpose in it they had never i think wanted to do so many things for
their poor protectress i mean though they got their lessons better and
better which was naturally what would please her most in the way of
diverting entertaining surprising her reading her passages telling
her stories acting her charades pouncing out at her in disguises as
animals and historical characters and above all astonishing her by the
pieces they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite
i should never get to the bottom were i to let myself go even now of
the prodigious private commentary all under still more private
correction with which in these days i overscored their full hours
they had shown me from the first a facility for everything a general
faculty which taking a fresh start achieved remarkable flights they
got their little tasks as if they loved them and indulged from the
mere exuberance of the gift in the most unimposed little miracles of
memory they not only popped out at me as tigers and as romans but as
shakespeareans astronomers and navigators this was so singularly the
case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which at
the present day i am at a loss for a different explanation i allude
to my unnatural composure on the subject of another school for miles
what i remember is that i was content not for the time to open the
question and that contentment must have sprung from the sense of his
perpetually striking show of cleverness he was too clever for a bad
governess for a parson s daughter to spoil and the strangest if not
the brightest thread in the pensive embroidery i just spoke of was the
impression i might have got if i had dared to work it out that he was
under some influence operating in his small intellectual life as a
tremendous incitement
if it was easy to reflect however that such a boy could postpone
school it was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been
kicked out by a schoolmaster was a mystification without end let me
add that in their company now and i was careful almost never to be out
of it i could follow no scent very far we lived in a cloud of music
and love and success and private theatricals the musical sense in each
of the children was of the quickest but the elder in especial had a
marvelous knack of catching and repeating the schoolroom piano broke
into all gruesome fancies and when that failed there were
confabulations in corners with a sequel of one of them going out in
the highest spirits in order to come in as something new i had had
brothers myself and it was no revelation to me that little girls could
be slavish idolaters of little boys what surpassed everything was that
there was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior
age sex and intelligence so fine a consideration they were
extraordinarily at one and to say that they never either quarreled or
complained is to make the note of praise coarse for their quality of
sweetness sometimes indeed when i dropped into coarseness i perhaps
came across traces of little understandings between them by which one
of them should keep me occupied while the other slipped away there is
a _na f_ side i suppose in all diplomacy but if my pupils practiced
upon me it was surely with the minimum of grossness it was all in the
other quarter that after a lull the grossness broke out
i find that i really hang back but i must take my plunge in going on
with the record of what was hideous at bly i not only challenge the
most liberal faith for which i little care but and this is another
matter i renew what i myself suffered i again push my way through it
to the end there came suddenly an hour after which as i look back
the affair seems to me to have been all pure suffering but i have at
least reached the heart of it and the straightest road out is
doubtless to advance one evening with nothing to lead up or to prepare
it i felt the cold touch of the impression that had breathed on me the
night of my arrival and which much lighter then as i have mentioned
i should probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent
sojourn been less agitated i had not gone to bed i sat reading by a
couple of candles there was a roomful of old books at bly last century
fiction some of it which to the extent of a distinctly deprecated
renown but never to so much as that of a stray specimen had reached
the sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of my
youth i remember that the book i had in my hand was fielding s
_amelia_ also that i was wholly awake i recall further both a general
conviction that it was horribly late and a particular objection to
looking at my watch i figure finally that the white curtain draping
in the fashion of those days the head of flora s little bed shrouded
as i had assured myself long before the perfection of childish rest i
recollect in short that though i was deeply interested in my author i
found myself at the turn of a page and with his spell all scattered
looking straight up from him and hard at the door of my room there was
a moment during which i listened reminded of the faint sense i had
had the first night of there being something undefinably astir in the
house and noted the soft breath of the open casement just move the
half drawn blind then with all the marks of a deliberation that must
have seemed magnificent had there been anyone to admire it i laid down
my book rose to my feet and taking a candle went straight out of
the room and from the passage on which my light made little
impression noiselessly closed and locked the door
i can say now neither what determined nor what guided me but i went
straight along the lobby holding my candle high till i came within
sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn of the
staircase at this point i precipitately found myself aware of three
things they were practically simultaneous yet they had flashes of
succession my candle under a bold flourish went out and i
perceived by the uncovered window that the yielding dusk of earliest
morning rendered it unnecessary without it the next instant i saw
that there was someone on the stair i speak of sequences but i
required no lapse of seconds to stiffen myself for a third encounter
with quint the apparition had reached the landing halfway up and was
therefore on the spot nearest the window where at sight of me it
stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower
and from the garden he knew me as well as i knew him and so in the
cold faint twilight with a glimmer in the high glass and another on
the polish of the oak stair below we faced each other in our common
intensity he was absolutely on this occasion a living detestable
dangerous presence but that was not the wonder of wonders i reserve
this distinction for quite another circumstance the circumstance that
dread had unmistakably quitted me and that there was nothing in me
there that didn t meet and measure him
i had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment but i had
thank god no terror and he knew i had not i found myself at the end
of an instant magnificently aware of this i felt in a fierce rigor of
confidence that if i stood my ground a minute i should cease for the
time at least to have him to reckon with and during the minute
accordingly the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview
hideous just because it _was_ human as human as to have met alone in
the small hours in a sleeping house some enemy some adventurer some
criminal it was the dead silence of our long gaze at such close
quarters that gave the whole horror huge as it was its only note of
the unnatural if i had met a murderer in such a place and at such an
hour we still at least would have spoken something would have passed
in life between us if nothing had passed one of us would have moved
the moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to
make me doubt if even _i_ were in life i can t express what followed
it save by saying that the silence itself which was indeed in a manner
an attestation of my strength became the element into which i saw the
figure disappear in which i definitely saw it turn as i might have
seen the low wretch to which it had once belonged turn on receipt of an
order and pass with my eyes on the villainous back that no hunch
could have more disfigured straight down the staircase and into the
darkness in which the next bend was lost
x
i remained awhile at the top of the stair but with the effect
presently of understanding that when my visitor had gone he had gone
then i returned to my room the foremost thing i saw there by the light
of the candle i had left burning was that flora s little bed was empty
and on this i caught my breath with all the terror that five minutes
before i had been able to resist i dashed at the place in which i had
left her lying and over which for the small silk counterpane and the
sheets were disarranged the white curtains had been deceivingly pulled
forward then my step to my unutterable relief produced an answering
sound i perceived an agitation of the window blind and the child
ducking down emerged rosily from the other side of it she stood there
in so much of her candor and so little of her nightgown with her pink
bare feet and the golden glow of her curls she looked intensely grave
and i had never had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired the
thrill of which had just been so prodigious as on my consciousness
that she addressed me with a reproach you naughty where _have_ you
been instead of challenging her own irregularity i found myself
arraigned and explaining she herself explained for that matter with
the loveliest eagerest simplicity she had known suddenly as she lay
there that i was out of the room and had jumped up to see what had
become of me i had dropped with the joy of her reappearance back
into my chair feeling then and then only a little faint and she had
pattered straight over to me thrown herself upon my knee given
herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful
little face that was still flushed with sleep i remember closing my
eyes an instant yieldingly consciously as before the excess of
something beautiful that shone out of the blue of her own you were
looking for me out of the window i said you thought i might be
walking in the grounds
well you know i thought someone was she never blanched as she
smiled out that at me
oh how i looked at her now and did you see anyone
ah _no _ she returned almost with the full privilege of childish
inconsequence resentfully though with a long sweetness in her little
drawl of the negative
at that moment in the state of my nerves i absolutely believed she
lied and if i once more closed my eyes it was before the dazzle of the
three or four possible ways in which i might take this up one of
these for a moment tempted me with such singular intensity that to
withstand it i must have gripped my little girl with a spasm that
wonderfully she submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright why
not break out at her on the spot and have it all over give it to her
straight in her lovely little lighted face you see you see you
_know_ that you do and that you already quite suspect i believe it
therefore why not frankly confess it to me so that we may at least
live with it together and learn perhaps in the strangeness of our
fate where we are and what it means this solicitation dropped alas
as it came if i could immediately have succumbed to it i might have
spared myself well you ll see what instead of succumbing i sprang
again to my feet looked at her bed and took a helpless middle way
why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were
still there
flora luminously considered after which with her little divine smile
because i don t like to frighten you
but if i had by your idea gone out
she absolutely declined to be puzzled she turned her eyes to the flame
of the candle as if the question were as irrelevant or at any rate as
impersonal as mrs marcet or nine times nine oh but you know she
quite adequately answered that you might come back you dear and
that you _have _ and after a little when she had got into bed i had
for a long time by almost sitting on her to hold her hand to prove
that i recognized the pertinence of my return
you may imagine the general complexion from that moment of my nights
i repeatedly sat up till i didn t know when i selected moments when my
roommate unmistakably slept and stealing out took noiseless turns in
the passage and even pushed as far as to where i had last met quint
but i never met him there again and i may as well say at once that i
on no other occasion saw him in the house i just missed on the
staircase on the other hand a different adventure looking down it
from the top i once recognized the presence of a woman seated on one of
the lower steps with her back presented to me her body half bowed and
her head in an attitude of woe in her hands i had been there but an
instant however when she vanished without looking round at me i
knew nonetheless exactly what dreadful face she had to show and i
wondered whether if instead of being above i had been below i should
have had for going up the same nerve i had lately shown quint well
there continued to be plenty of chance for nerve on the eleventh night
after my latest encounter with that gentleman they were all numbered
now i had an alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed from the
particular quality of its unexpectedness proved quite my sharpest
shock it was precisely the first night during this series that weary
with watching i had felt that i might again without laxity lay myself
down at my old hour i slept immediately and as i afterward knew till
about one o clock but when i woke it was to sit straight up as
completely roused as if a hand had shook me i had left a light
burning but it was now out and i felt an instant certainty that flora
had extinguished it this brought me to my feet and straight in the
darkness to her bed which i found she had left a glance at the
window enlightened me further and the striking of a match completed
the picture
the child had again got up this time blowing out the taper and had
again for some purpose of observation or response squeezed in behind
the blind and was peering out into the night that she now saw as she
had not i had satisfied myself the previous time was proved to me by
the fact that she was disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the
haste i made to get into slippers and into a wrap hidden protected
absorbed she evidently rested on the sill the casement opened
forward and gave herself up there was a great still moon to help her
and this fact had counted in my quick decision she was face to face
with the apparition we had met at the lake and could now communicate
with it as she had not then been able to do what i on my side had to
care for was without disturbing her to reach from the corridor some
other window in the same quarter i got to the door without her hearing
me i got out of it closed it and listened from the other side for
some sound from her while i stood in the passage i had my eyes on her
brother s door which was but ten steps off and which indescribably
produced in me a renewal of the strange impulse that i lately spoke of
as my temptation what if i should go straight in and march to _his_
window what if by risking to his boyish bewilderment a revelation of
my motive i should throw across the rest of the mystery the long
halter of my boldness
this thought held me sufficiently to make me cross to his threshold and
pause again i preternaturally listened i figured to myself what might
portentously be i wondered if his bed were also empty and he too were
secretly at watch it was a deep soundless minute at the end of which
my impulse failed he was quiet he might be innocent the risk was
hideous i turned away there was a figure in the grounds a figure
prowling for a sight the visitor with whom flora was engaged but it
was not the visitor most concerned with my boy i hesitated afresh but
on other grounds and only for a few seconds then i had made my choice
there were empty rooms at bly and it was only a question of choosing
the right one the right one suddenly presented itself to me as the
lower one though high above the gardens in the solid corner of the
house that i have spoken of as the old tower this was a large square
chamber arranged with some state as a bedroom the extravagant size of
which made it so inconvenient that it had not for years though kept by
mrs grose in exemplary order been occupied i had often admired it
and i knew my way about in it i had only after just faltering at the
first chill gloom of its disuse to pass across it and unbolt as
quietly as i could one of the shutters achieving this transit i
uncovered the glass without a sound and applying my face to the pane
was able the darkness without being much less than within to see that
i commanded the right direction then i saw something more the moon
made the night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the lawn a
person diminished by distance who stood there motionless and as if
fascinated looking up to where i had appeared looking that is not so
much straight at me as at something that was apparently above me there
was clearly another person above me there was a person on the tower
but the presence on the lawn was not in the least what i had conceived
and had confidently hurried to meet the presence on the lawn i felt
sick as i made it out was poor little miles himself
xi
it was not till late next day that i spoke to mrs grose the rigor
with which i kept my pupils in sight making it often difficult to meet
her privately and the more as we each felt the importance of not
provoking on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the
children any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of
mysteries i drew a great security in this particular from her mere
smooth aspect there was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others
my horrible confidences she believed me i was sure absolutely if
she hadn t i don t know what would have become of me for i couldn t
have borne the business alone but she was a magnificent monument to
the blessing of a want of imagination and if she could see in our
little charges nothing but their beauty and amiability their happiness
and cleverness she had no direct communication with the sources of my
trouble if they had been at all visibly blighted or battered she
would doubtless have grown on tracing it back haggard enough to match
them as matters stood however i could feel her when she surveyed
them with her large white arms folded and the habit of serenity in all
her look thank the lord s mercy that if they were ruined the pieces
would still serve flights of fancy gave place in her mind to a
steady fireside glow and i had already begun to perceive how with the
development of the conviction that as time went on without a public
accident our young things could after all look out for themselves
she addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by
their instructress that for myself was a sound simplification i
could engage that to the world my face should tell no tales but it
would have been in the conditions an immense added strain to find
myself anxious about hers
at the hour i now speak of she had joined me under pressure on the
terrace where with the lapse of the season the afternoon sun was now
agreeable and we sat there together while before us at a distance
but within call if we wished the children strolled to and fro in one
of their most manageable moods they moved slowly in unison below us
over the lawn the boy as they went reading aloud from a storybook
and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch mrs
grose watched them with positive placidity then i caught the
suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to
take from me a view of the back of the tapestry i had made her a
receptacle of lurid things but there was an odd recognition of my
superiority my accomplishments and my function in her patience under my
pain she offered her mind to my disclosures as had i wished to mix a
witch s broth and proposed it with assurance she would have held out a
large clean saucepan this had become thoroughly her attitude by the
time that in my recital of the events of the night i reached the
point of what miles had said to me when after seeing him at such a
monstrous hour almost on the very spot where he happened now to be i
had gone down to bring him in choosing then at the window with a
concentrated need of not alarming the house rather that method than a
signal more resonant i had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my
small hope of representing with success even to her actual sympathy my
sense of the real splendor of the little inspiration with which after
i had got him into the house the boy met my final articulate
challenge as soon as i appeared in the moonlight on the terrace he
had come to me as straight as possible on which i had taken his hand
without a word and led him through the dark spaces up the staircase
where quint had so hungrily hovered for him along the lobby where i
had listened and trembled and so to his forsaken room
not a sound on the way had passed between us and i had wondered oh
_how_ i had wondered if he were groping about in his little mind for
something plausible and not too grotesque it would tax his invention
certainly and i felt this time over his real embarrassment a
curious thrill of triumph it was a sharp trap for the inscrutable he
couldn t play any longer at innocence so how the deuce would he get
out of it there beat in me indeed with the passionate throb of this
question an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce _i_ should i was
confronted at last as never yet with all the risk attached even now
to sounding my own horrid note i remember in fact that as we pushed
into his little chamber where the bed had not been slept in at all and
the window uncovered to the moonlight made the place so clear that
there was no need of striking a match i remember how i suddenly
dropped sank upon the edge of the bed from the force of the idea that
he must know how he really as they say had me he could do what he
liked with all his cleverness to help him so long as i should
continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those
caretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears he
had me indeed and in a cleft stick for who would ever absolve me
who would consent that i should go unhung if by the faintest tremor
of an overture i were the first to introduce into our perfect
intercourse an element so dire no no it was useless to attempt to
convey to mrs grose just as it is scarcely less so to attempt to
suggest here how in our short stiff brush in the dark he fairly
shook me with admiration i was of course thoroughly kind and merciful
never never yet had i placed on his little shoulders hands of such
tenderness as those with which while i rested against the bed i held
him there well under fire i had no alternative but in form at least
to put it to him
you must tell me now and all the truth what did you go out for what
were you doing there
i can still see his wonderful smile the whites of his beautiful eyes
and the uncovering of his little teeth shine to me in the dusk if i
tell you why will you understand my heart at this leaped into my
mouth _would_ he tell me why i found no sound on my lips to press it
and i was aware of replying only with a vague repeated grimacing nod
he was gentleness itself and while i wagged my head at him he stood
there more than ever a little fairy prince it was his brightness
indeed that gave me a respite would it be so great if he were really
going to tell me well he said at last just exactly in order that
you should do this
do what
think me for a change _bad _ i shall never forget the sweetness and
gaiety with which he brought out the word nor how on top of it he
bent forward and kissed me it was practically the end of everything i
met his kiss and i had to make while i folded him for a minute in my
arms the most stupendous effort not to cry he had given exactly the
account of himself that permitted least of my going behind it and it
was only with the effect of confirming my acceptance of it that as i
presently glanced about the room i could say
then you didn t undress at all
he fairly glittered in the gloom not at all i sat up and read
and when did you go down
at midnight when i m bad i _am_ bad
i see i see it s charming but how could you be sure i would know
it
oh i arranged that with flora his answers rang out with a
readiness she was to get up and look out
which is what she did do it was i who fell into the trap
so she disturbed you and to see what she was looking at you also
looked you saw
while you i concurred caught your death in the night air
he literally bloomed so from this exploit that he could afford
radiantly to assent how otherwise should i have been bad enough he
asked then after another embrace the incident and our interview
closed on my recognition of all the reserves of goodness that for his
joke he had been able to draw upon
xii
the particular impression i had received proved in the morning light i
repeat not quite successfully presentable to mrs grose though i
reinforced it with the mention of still another remark that he had made
before we separated it all lies in half a dozen words i said to
her words that really settle the matter think you know what i
_might_ do he threw that off to show me how good he is he knows down
to the ground what he might do that s what he gave them a taste of
at school
lord you do change cried my friend
i don t change i simply make it out the four depend upon it
perpetually meet if on either of these last nights you had been with
either child you would clearly have understood the more i ve watched
and waited the more i ve felt that if there were nothing else to make
it sure it would be made so by the systematic silence of each _never_
by a slip of the tongue have they so much as alluded to either of
their old friends any more than miles has alluded to his expulsion
oh yes we may sit here and look at them and they may show off to us
there to their fill but even while they pretend to be lost in their
fairytale they re steeped in their vision of the dead restored he s
not reading to her i declared they re talking of _them_ they re
talking horrors i go on i know as if i were crazy and it s a wonder
i m not what i ve seen would have made _you_ so but it has only made
me more lucid made me get hold of still other things
my lucidity must have seemed awful but the charming creatures who were
victims of it passing and repassing in their interlocked sweetness
gave my colleague something to hold on by and i felt how tight she
held as without stirring in the breath of my passion she covered them
still with her eyes of what other things have you got hold
why of the very things that have delighted fascinated and yet at
bottom as i now so strangely see mystified and troubled me their
more than earthly beauty their absolutely unnatural goodness it s a
game i went on it s a policy and a fraud
on the part of little darlings
as yet mere lovely babies yes mad as that seems the very act of
bringing it out really helped me to trace it follow it all up and piece
it all together they haven t been good they ve only been absent it
has been easy to live with them because they re simply leading a life
of their own they re not mine they re not ours they re his and
they re hers
quint s and that woman s
quint s and that woman s they want to get to them
oh how at this poor mrs grose appeared to study them but for
what
for the love of all the evil that in those dreadful days the pair
put into them and to ply them with that evil still to keep up the
work of demons is what brings the others back
laws said my friend under her breath the exclamation was homely
but it revealed a real acceptance of my further proof of what in the
bad time for there had been a worse even than this must have occurred
there could have been no such justification for me as the plain assent
of her experience to whatever depth of depravity i found credible in
our brace of scoundrels it was in obvious submission of memory that
she brought out after a moment they _were_ rascals but what can they
now do she pursued
do i echoed so loud that miles and flora as they passed at their
distance paused an instant in their walk and looked at us don t they
do enough i demanded in a lower tone while the children having
smiled and nodded and kissed hands to us resumed their exhibition we
were held by it a minute then i answered they can destroy them at
this my companion did turn but the inquiry she launched was a silent
one the effect of which was to make me more explicit they don t
know as yet quite how but they re trying hard they re seen only
across as it were and beyond in strange places and on high places
the top of towers the roof of houses the outside of windows the
further edge of pools but there s a deep design on either side to
shorten the distance and overcome the obstacle and the success of the
tempters is only a question of time they ve only to keep to their
suggestions of danger
for the children to come
and perish in the attempt mrs grose slowly got up and i
scrupulously added unless of course we can prevent
standing there before me while i kept my seat she visibly turned
things over their uncle must do the preventing he must take them
away
and who s to make him
she had been scanning the distance but she now dropped on me a foolish
face you miss
by writing to him that his house is poisoned and his little nephew and
niece mad
but if they _are_ miss
and if i am myself you mean that s charming news to be sent him by a
governess whose prime undertaking was to give him no worry
mrs grose considered following the children again yes he do hate
worry that was the great reason
why those fiends took him in so long no doubt though his
indifference must have been awful as i m not a fiend at any rate i
shouldn t take him in
my companion after an instant and for all answer sat down again and
grasped my arm make him at any rate come to you
i stared to _me _ i had a sudden fear of what she might do him
he ought to _be_ here he ought to help
i quickly rose and i think i must have shown her a queerer face than
ever yet you see me asking him for a visit no with her eyes on my
face she evidently couldn t instead of it even as a woman reads
another she could see what i myself saw his derision his amusement
his contempt for the breakdown of my resignation at being left alone
and for the fine machinery i had set in motion to attract his attention
to my slighted charms she didn t know no one knew how proud i had been
to serve him and to stick to our terms yet she nonetheless took the
measure i think of the warning i now gave her if you should so lose
your head as to appeal to him for me
she was really frightened yes miss
i would leave on the spot both him and you
xiii
it was all very well to join them but speaking to them proved quite as
much as ever an effort beyond my strength offered in close quarters
difficulties as insurmountable as before this situation continued a
month and with new aggravations and particular notes the note above
all sharper and sharper of the small ironic consciousness on the part
of my pupils it was not i am as sure today as i was sure then my
mere infernal imagination it was absolutely traceable that they were
aware of my predicament and that this strange relation made in a
manner for a long time the air in which we moved i don t mean that
they had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar for that
was not one of their dangers i do mean on the other hand that the
element of the unnamed and untouched became between us greater than
any other and that so much avoidance could not have been so
successfully effected without a great deal of tacit arrangement it was
as if at moments we were perpetually coming into sight of subjects
before which we must stop short turning suddenly out of alleys that we
perceived to be blind closing with a little bang that made us look at
each other for like all bangs it was something louder than we had
intended the doors we had indiscreetly opened all roads lead to rome
and there were times when it might have struck us that almost every
branch of study or subject of conversation skirted forbidden ground
forbidden ground was the question of the return of the dead in general
and of whatever in especial might survive in memory of the friends
little children had lost there were days when i could have sworn that
one of them had with a small invisible nudge said to the other she
thinks she ll do it this time but she _won t _ to do it would have
been to indulge for instance and for once in a way in some direct
reference to the lady who had prepared them for my discipline they had
a delightful endless appetite for passages in my own history to which
i had again and again treated them they were in possession of
everything that had ever happened to me had had with every
circumstance the story of my smallest adventures and of those of my
brothers and sisters and of the cat and the dog at home as well as
many particulars of the eccentric nature of my father of the furniture
and arrangement of our house and of the conversation of the old women
of our village there were things enough taking one with another to
chatter about if one went very fast and knew by instinct when to go
round they pulled with an art of their own the strings of my invention
and my memory and nothing else perhaps when i thought of such
occasions afterward gave me so the suspicion of being watched from
under cover it was in any case over _my_ life _my_ past and _my_
friends alone that we could take anything like our ease a state of
affairs that led them sometimes without the least pertinence to break
out into sociable reminders i was invited with no visible
connection to repeat afresh goody gosling s celebrated _mot_ or to
confirm the details already supplied as to the cleverness of the
vicarage pony
it was partly at such junctures as these and partly at quite different
ones that with the turn my matters had now taken my predicament as i
have called it grew most sensible the fact that the days passed for
me without another encounter ought it would have appeared to have
done something toward soothing my nerves since the light brush that
second night on the upper landing of the presence of a woman at the
foot of the stair i had seen nothing whether in or out of the house
that one had better not have seen there was many a corner round which
i expected to come upon quint and many a situation that in a merely
sinister way would have favored the appearance of miss jessel the
summer had turned the summer had gone the autumn had dropped upon bly
and had blown out half our lights the place with its gray sky and
withered garlands its bared spaces and scattered dead leaves was like
a theater after the performance all strewn with crumpled playbills
there were exactly states of the air conditions of sound and of
stillness unspeakable impressions of the _kind_ of ministering moment
that brought back to me long enough to catch it the feeling of the
medium in which that june evening out of doors i had had my first
sight of quint and in which too at those other instants i had
after seeing him through the window looked for him in vain in the
circle of shrubbery i recognized the signs the portents i recognized
the moment the spot but they remained unaccompanied and empty and i
continued unmolested if unmolested one could call a young woman whose
sensibility had in the most extraordinary fashion not declined but
deepened i had said in my talk with mrs grose on that horrid scene of
flora s by the lake and had perplexed her by so saying that it would
from that moment distress me much more to lose my power than to keep
it i had then expressed what was vividly in my mind the truth that
whether the children really saw or not since that is it was not yet
definitely proved i greatly preferred as a safeguard the fullness of
my own exposure i was ready to know the very worst that was to be
known what i had then had an ugly glimpse of was that my eyes might be
sealed just while theirs were most opened well my eyes _were_ sealed
it appeared at present a consummation for which it seemed blasphemous
not to thank god there was alas a difficulty about that i would
have thanked him with all my soul had i not had in a proportionate
measure this conviction of the secret of my pupils
how can i retrace today the strange steps of my obsession there were
times of our being together when i would have been ready to swear that
literally in my presence but with my direct sense of it closed they
had visitors who were known and were welcome then it was that had i
not been deterred by the very chance that such an injury might prove
greater than the injury to be averted my exultation would have broken
out they re here they re here you little wretches i would have
cried and you can t deny it now the little wretches denied it with
all the added volume of their sociability and their tenderness in just
the crystal depths of which like the flash of a fish in a stream the
mockery of their advantage peeped up the shock in truth had sunk
into me still deeper than i knew on the night when looking out to see
either quint or miss jessel under the stars i had beheld the boy over
whose rest i watched and who had immediately brought in with him had
straightway there turned it on me the lovely upward look with which
from the battlements above me the hideous apparition of quint had
played if it was a question of a scare my discovery on this occasion
had scared me more than any other and it was in the condition of
nerves produced by it that i made my actual inductions they harassed
me so that sometimes at odd moments i shut myself up audibly to
rehearse it was at once a fantastic relief and a renewed despair the
manner in which i might come to the point i approached it from one
side and the other while in my room i flung myself about but i
always broke down in the monstrous utterance of names as they died
away on my lips i said to myself that i should indeed help them to
represent something infamous if by pronouncing them i should violate
as rare a little case of instinctive delicacy as any schoolroom
probably had ever known when i said to myself _they_ have the
manners to be silent and you trusted as you are the baseness to
speak i felt myself crimson and i covered my face with my hands
after these secret scenes i chattered more than ever going on volubly
enough till one of our prodigious palpable hushes occurred i can call
them nothing else the strange dizzy lift or swim i try for terms
into a stillness a pause of all life that had nothing to do with the
more or less noise that at the moment we might be engaged in making and
that i could hear through any deepened exhilaration or quickened
recitation or louder strum of the piano then it was that the others
the outsiders were there though they were not angels they passed
as the french say causing me while they stayed to tremble with the
fear of their addressing to their younger victims some yet more
infernal message or more vivid image than they had thought good enough
for myself
what it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that
whatever i had seen miles and flora saw _more_ things terrible and
unguessable and that sprang from dreadful passages of intercourse in
the past such things naturally left on the surface for the time a
chill which we vociferously denied that we felt and we had all three
with repetition got into such splendid training that we went each
time almost automatically to mark the close of the incident through
the very same movements it was striking of the children at all
events to kiss me inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and
never to fail one or the other of the precious question that had helped
us through many a peril when do you think he _will_ come don t you
think we _ought_ to write there was nothing like that inquiry we
found by experience for carrying off an awkwardness he of course
was their uncle in harley street and we lived in much profusion of
theory that he might at any moment arrive to mingle in our circle it
was impossible to have given less encouragement than he had done to
such a doctrine but if we had not had the doctrine to fall back upon
we should have deprived each other of some of our finest exhibitions
he never wrote to them that may have been selfish but it was a part of
the flattery of his trust of me for the way in which a man pays his
highest tribute to a woman is apt to be but by the more festal
celebration of one of the sacred laws of his comfort and i held that i
carried out the spirit of the pledge given not to appeal to him when i
let my charges understand that their own letters were but charming
literary exercises they were too beautiful to be posted i kept them
myself i have them all to this hour this was a rule indeed which only
added to the satiric effect of my being plied with the supposition that
he might at any moment be among us it was exactly as if my charges
knew how almost more awkward than anything else that might be for me
there appears to me moreover as i look back no note in all this more
extraordinary than the mere fact that in spite of my tension and of
their triumph i never lost patience with them adorable they must in
truth have been i now reflect that i didn t in these days hate them
would exasperation however if relief had longer been postponed
finally have betrayed me it little matters for relief arrived i call
it relief though it was only the relief that a snap brings to a strain
or the burst of a thunderstorm to a day of suffocation it was at least
change and it came with a rush
xiv
walking to church a certain sunday morning i had little miles at my
side and his sister in advance of us and at mrs grose s well in
sight it was a crisp clear day the first of its order for some time
the night had brought a touch of frost and the autumn air bright and
sharp made the church bells almost gay it was an odd accident of
thought that i should have happened at such a moment to be particularly
and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little charges why
did they never resent my inexorable my perpetual society something or
other had brought nearer home to me that i had all but pinned the boy
to my shawl and that in the way our companions were marshaled before
me i might have appeared to provide against some danger of rebellion
i was like a gaoler with an eye to possible surprises and escapes but
all this belonged i mean their magnificent little surrender just to the
special array of the facts that were most abysmal turned out for
sunday by his uncle s tailor who had had a free hand and a notion of
pretty waistcoats and of his grand little air miles s whole title to
independence the rights of his sex and situation were so stamped upon
him that if he had suddenly struck for freedom i should have had
nothing to say i was by the strangest of chances wondering how i
should meet him when the revolution unmistakably occurred i call it a
revolution because i now see how with the word he spoke the curtain
rose on the last act of my dreadful drama and the catastrophe was
precipitated look here my dear you know he charmingly said when
in the world please am i going back to school
transcribed here the speech sounds harmless enough particularly as
uttered in the sweet high casual pipe with which at all
interlocutors but above all at his eternal governess he threw off
intonations as if he were tossing roses there was something in them
that always made one catch and i caught at any rate now so
effectually that i stopped as short as if one of the trees of the park
had fallen across the road there was something new on the spot
between us and he was perfectly aware that i recognized it though to
enable me to do so he had no need to look a whit less candid and
charming than usual i could feel in him how he already from my at
first finding nothing to reply perceived the advantage he had gained
i was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time after a
minute to continue with his suggestive but inconclusive smile you
know my dear that for a fellow to be with a lady _always_ his my
dear was constantly on his lips for me and nothing could have
expressed more the exact shade of the sentiment with which i desired to
inspire my pupils than its fond familiarity it was so respectfully
easy
but oh how i felt that at present i must pick my own phrases i
remember that to gain time i tried to laugh and i seemed to see in
the beautiful face with which he watched me how ugly and queer i
looked and always with the same lady i returned
he neither blanched nor winked the whole thing was virtually out
between us ah of course she s a jolly perfect lady but after
all i m a fellow don t you see that s well getting on
i lingered there with him an instant ever so kindly yes you re
getting on oh but i felt helpless
i have kept to this day the heartbreaking little idea of how he seemed
to know that and to play with it and you can t say i ve not been
awfully good can you
i laid my hand on his shoulder for though i felt how much better it
would have been to walk on i was not yet quite able no i can t say
that miles
except just that one night you know
that one night i couldn t look as straight as he
why when i went down went out of the house
oh yes but i forget what you did it for
you forget he spoke with the sweet extravagance of childish
reproach why it was to show you i could
oh yes you could
and i can again
i felt that i might perhaps after all succeed in keeping my wits
about me certainly but you won t
no not _that_ again it was nothing
it was nothing i said but we must go on
he resumed our walk with me passing his hand into my arm then when
_am_ i going back
i wore in turning it over my most responsible air were you very
happy at school
he just considered oh i m happy enough anywhere
well then i quavered if you re just as happy here
ah but that isn t everything of course _you_ know a lot
but you hint that you know almost as much i risked as he paused
not half i want to miles honestly professed but it isn t so much
that
what is it then
well i want to see more life
i see i see we had arrived within sight of the church and of
various persons including several of the household of bly on their
way to it and clustered about the door to see us go in i quickened our
step i wanted to get there before the question between us opened up
much further i reflected hungrily that for more than an hour he
would have to be silent and i thought with envy of the comparative
dusk of the pew and of the almost spiritual help of the hassock on
which i might bend my knees i seemed literally to be running a race
with some confusion to which he was about to reduce me but i felt that
he had got in first when before we had even entered the churchyard he
threw out
i want my own sort
it literally made me bound forward there are not many of your own
sort miles i laughed unless perhaps dear little flora
you really compare me to a baby girl
this found me singularly weak don t you then _love_ our sweet
flora
if i didn t and you too if i didn t he repeated as if retreating
for a jump yet leaving his thought so unfinished that after we had
come into the gate another stop which he imposed on me by the
pressure of his arm had become inevitable mrs grose and flora had
passed into the church the other worshippers had followed and we
were for the minute alone among the old thick graves we had paused
on the path from the gate by a low oblong tablelike tomb
yes if you didn t
he looked while i waited at the graves well you know what but he
didn t move and he presently produced something that made me drop
straight down on the stone slab as if suddenly to rest does my uncle
think what _you_ think
i markedly rested how do you know what i think
ah well of course i don t for it strikes me you never tell me but
i mean does _he_ know
know what miles
why the way i m going on
i perceived quickly enough that i could make to this inquiry no
answer that would not involve something of a sacrifice of my employer
yet it appeared to me that we were all at bly sufficiently sacrificed
to make that venial i don t think your uncle much cares
miles on this stood looking at me then don t you think he can be
made to
in what way
why by his coming down
but who ll get him to come down
_i_ will the boy said with extraordinary brightness and emphasis he
gave me another look charged with that expression and then marched off
alone into church
xv
the business was practically settled from the moment i never followed
him it was a pitiful surrender to agitation but my being aware of
this had somehow no power to restore me i only sat there on my tomb
and read into what my little friend had said to me the fullness of its
meaning by the time i had grasped the whole of which i had also
embraced for absence the pretext that i was ashamed to offer my
pupils and the rest of the congregation such an example of delay what
i said to myself above all was that miles had got something out of me
and that the proof of it for him would be just this awkward collapse
he had got out of me that there was something i was much afraid of and
that he should probably be able to make use of my fear to gain for his
own purpose more freedom my fear was of having to deal with the
intolerable question of the grounds of his dismissal from school for
that was really but the question of the horrors gathered behind that
his uncle should arrive to treat with me of these things was a solution
that strictly speaking i ought now to have desired to bring on but i
could so little face the ugliness and the pain of it that i simply
procrastinated and lived from hand to mouth the boy to my deep
discomposure was immensely in the right was in a position to say to
me either you clear up with my guardian the mystery of this
interruption of my studies or you cease to expect me to lead with you
a life that s so unnatural for a boy what was so unnatural for the
particular boy i was concerned with was this sudden revelation of a
consciousness and a plan
that was what really overcame me what prevented my going in i walked
round the church hesitating hovering i reflected that i had already
with him hurt myself beyond repair therefore i could patch up
nothing and it was too extreme an effort to squeeze beside him into
the pew he would be so much more sure than ever to pass his arm into
mine and make me sit there for an hour in close silent contact with
his commentary on our talk for the first minute since his arrival i
wanted to get away from him as i paused beneath the high east window
and listened to the sounds of worship i was taken with an impulse that
might master me i felt completely should i give it the least
encouragement i might easily put an end to my predicament by getting
away altogether here was my chance there was no one to stop me i
could give the whole thing up turn my back and retreat it was only a
question of hurrying again for a few preparations to the house which
the attendance at church of so many of the servants would practically
have left unoccupied no one in short could blame me if i should just
drive desperately off what was it to get away if i got away only till
dinner that would be in a couple of hours at the end of which i had
the acute prevision my little pupils would play at innocent wonder
about my nonappearance in their train
what _did_ you do you naughty bad thing why in the world to worry
us so and take our thoughts off too don t you know did you desert us
at the very door i couldn t meet such questions nor as they asked
them their false little lovely eyes yet it was all so exactly what i
should have to meet that as the prospect grew sharp to me i at last
let myself go
i got so far as the immediate moment was concerned away i came
straight out of the churchyard and thinking hard retraced my steps
through the park it seemed to me that by the time i reached the house
i had made up my mind i would fly the sunday stillness both of the
approaches and of the interior in which i met no one fairly excited
me with a sense of opportunity were i to get off quickly this way i
should get off without a scene without a word my quickness would have
to be remarkable however and the question of a conveyance was the
great one to settle tormented in the hall with difficulties and
obstacles i remember sinking down at the foot of the
staircase suddenly collapsing there on the lowest step and then with a
revulsion recalling that it was exactly where more than a month
before in the darkness of night and just so bowed with evil things i
had seen the specter of the most horrible of women at this i was able
to straighten myself i went the rest of the way up i made in my
bewilderment for the schoolroom where there were objects belonging to
me that i should have to take but i opened the door to find again in
a flash my eyes unsealed in the presence of what i saw i reeled
straight back upon my resistance
seated at my own table in clear noonday light i saw a person whom
without my previous experience i should have taken at the first blush
for some housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the
place and who availing herself of rare relief from observation and of
the schoolroom table and my pens ink and paper had applied herself
to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart there was an
effort in the way that while her arms rested on the table her hands
with evident weariness supported her head but at the moment i took
this in i had already become aware that in spite of my entrance her
attitude strangely persisted then it was with the very act of its
announcing itself that her identity flared up in a change of posture
she rose not as if she had heard me but with an indescribable grand
melancholy of indifference and detachment and within a dozen feet of
me stood there as my vile predecessor dishonored and tragic she was
all before me but even as i fixed and for memory secured it the
awful image passed away dark as midnight in her black dress her
haggard beauty and her unutterable woe she had looked at me long
enough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good
as mine to sit at hers while these instants lasted indeed i had the
extraordinary chill of feeling that it was i who was the intruder it
was as a wild protest against it that actually addressing her you
terrible miserable woman i heard myself break into a sound that by
the open door rang through the long passage and the empty house she
looked at me as if she heard me but i had recovered myself and cleared
the air there was nothing in the room the next minute but the sunshine
and a sense that i must stay
xvi
i had so perfectly expected that the return of my pupils would be
marked by a demonstration that i was freshly upset at having to take
into account that they were dumb about my absence instead of gaily
denouncing and caressing me they made no allusion to my having failed
them and i was left for the time on perceiving that she too said
nothing to study mrs grose s odd face i did this to such purpose
that i made sure they had in some way bribed her to silence a silence
that however i would engage to break down on the first private
opportunity this opportunity came before tea i secured five minutes
with her in the housekeeper s room where in the twilight amid a
smell of lately baked bread but with the place all swept and
garnished i found her sitting in pained placidity before the fire so
i see her still so i see her best facing the flame from her straight
chair in the dusky shining room a large clean image of the put
away of drawers closed and locked and rest without a remedy
oh yes they asked me to say nothing and to please them so long as
they were there of course i promised but what had happened to you
i only went with you for the walk i said i had then to come back
to meet a friend
she showed her surprise a friend _you _
oh yes i have a couple i laughed but did the children give you a
reason
for not alluding to your leaving us yes they said you would like it
better do you like it better
my face had made her rueful no i like it worse but after an
instant i added did they say why i should like it better
no master miles only said we must do nothing but what she likes
i wish indeed he would and what did flora say
miss flora was too sweet she said oh of course of course and i
said the same
i thought a moment you were too sweet too i can hear you all but
nonetheless between miles and me it s now all out
all out my companion stared but what miss
everything it doesn t matter i ve made up my mind i came home my
dear i went on for a talk with miss jessel
i had by this time formed the habit of having mrs grose literally well
in hand in advance of my sounding that note so that even now as she
bravely blinked under the signal of my word i could keep her
comparatively firm a talk do you mean she spoke
it came to that i found her on my return in the schoolroom
and what did she say i can hear the good woman still and the candor
of her stupefaction
that she suffers the torments
it was this of a truth that made her as she filled out my picture
gape do you mean she faltered of the lost
of the lost of the damned and that s why to share them i faltered
myself with the horror of it
but my companion with less imagination kept me up to share them
she wants flora mrs grose might as i gave it to her fairly have
fallen away from me had i not been prepared i still held her there to
show i was as i ve told you however it doesn t matter
because you ve made up your mind but to what
to everything
and what do you call everything
why sending for their uncle
oh miss in pity do my friend broke out ah but i will i _will _
i see it s the only way what s out as i told you with miles is
that if he thinks i m afraid to and has ideas of what he gains by
that he shall see he s mistaken yes yes his uncle shall have it here
from me on the spot and before the boy himself if necessary that if
i m to be reproached with having done nothing again about more school
yes miss my companion pressed me
well there s that awful reason
there were now clearly so many of these for my poor colleague that she
was excusable for being vague but a which
why the letter from his old place
you ll show it to the master
i ought to have done so on the instant
oh no said mrs grose with decision
i ll put it before him i went on inexorably that i can t undertake
to work the question on behalf of a child who has been expelled
for we ve never in the least known what mrs grose declared
for wickedness for what else when he s so clever and beautiful and
perfect is he stupid is he untidy is he infirm is he ill natured
he s exquisite so it can be only _that_ and that would open up the
whole thing after all i said it s their uncle s fault if he left
here such people
he didn t really in the least know them the fault s mine she had
turned quite pale
well you shan t suffer i answered
the children shan t she emphatically returned
i was silent awhile we looked at each other then what am i to tell
him
you needn t tell him anything _i ll_ tell him
i measured this do you mean you ll write remembering she couldn t
i caught myself up how do you communicate
i tell the bailiff _he_ writes
and should you like him to write our story
my question had a sarcastic force that i had not fully intended and it
made her after a moment inconsequently break down the tears were
again in her eyes ah miss _you_ write
well tonight i at last answered and on this we separated
xvii
i went so far in the evening as to make a beginning the weather had
changed back a great wind was abroad and beneath the lamp in my
room with flora at peace beside me i sat for a long time before a
blank sheet of paper and listened to the lash of the rain and the
batter of the gusts finally i went out taking a candle i crossed the
passage and listened a minute at miles s door what under my endless
obsession i had been impelled to listen for was some betrayal of his
not being at rest and i presently caught one but not in the form i
had expected his voice tinkled out i say you there come in it was
a gaiety in the gloom
i went in with my light and found him in bed very wide awake but
very much at his ease well what are _you_ up to he asked with a
grace of sociability in which it occurred to me that mrs grose had
she been present might have looked in vain for proof that anything was
out
i stood over him with my candle how did you know i was there
why of course i heard you did you fancy you made no noise you re
like a troop of cavalry he beautifully laughed
then you weren t asleep
not much i lie awake and think
i had put my candle designedly a short way off and then as he held
out his friendly old hand to me had sat down on the edge of his bed
what is it i asked that you think of
what in the world my dear but _you _
ah the pride i take in your appreciation doesn t insist on that i
had so far rather you slept
well i think also you know of this queer business of ours
i marked the coolness of his firm little hand of what queer business
miles
why the way you bring me up and all the rest
i fairly held my breath a minute and even from my glimmering taper
there was light enough to show how he smiled up at me from his pillow
what do you mean by all the rest
oh you know you know
i could say nothing for a minute though i felt as i held his hand and
our eyes continued to meet that my silence had all the air of
admitting his charge and that nothing in the whole world of reality was
perhaps at that moment so fabulous as our actual relation certainly
you shall go back to school i said if it be that that troubles you
but not to the old place we must find another a better how could i
know it did trouble you this question when you never told me so
never spoke of it at all his clear listening face framed in its
smooth whiteness made him for the minute as appealing as some wistful
patient in a children s hospital and i would have given as the
resemblance came to me all i possessed on earth really to be the nurse
or the sister of charity who might have helped to cure him well even
as it was i perhaps might help do you know you ve never said a word
to me about your school i mean the old one never mentioned it in any
way
he seemed to wonder he smiled with the same loveliness but he clearly
gained time he waited he called for guidance haven t i it wasn t
for _me_ to help him it was for the thing i had met
something in his tone and the expression of his face as i got this
from him set my heart aching with such a pang as it had never yet
known so unutterably touching was it to see his little brain puzzled
and his little resources taxed to play under the spell laid on him a
part of innocence and consistency no never from the hour you came
back you ve never mentioned to me one of your masters one of your
comrades nor the least little thing that ever happened to you at
school never little miles no never have you given me an inkling of
anything that _may_ have happened there therefore you can fancy how
much i m in the dark until you came out that way this morning you
had since the first hour i saw you scarce even made a reference to
anything in your previous life you seemed so perfectly to accept the
present it was extraordinary how my absolute conviction of his secret
precocity or whatever i might call the poison of an influence that i
dared but half to phrase made him in spite of the faint breath of his
inward trouble appear as accessible as an older person imposed him
almost as an intellectual equal i thought you wanted to go on as you
are
it struck me that at this he just faintly colored he gave at any
rate like a convalescent slightly fatigued a languid shake of his
head i don t i don t i want to get away
you re tired of bly
oh no i like bly
well then
oh _you_ know what a boy wants
i felt that i didn t know so well as miles and i took temporary
refuge you want to go to your uncle
again at this with his sweet ironic face he made a movement on the
pillow ah you can t get off with that
i was silent a little and it was i now i think who changed color
my dear i don t want to get off
you can t even if you do you can t you can t he lay beautifully
staring my uncle must come down and you must completely settle
things
if we do i returned with some spirit you may be sure it will be to
take you quite away
well don t you understand that that s exactly what i m working for
you ll have to tell him about the way you ve let it all drop you ll
have to tell him a tremendous lot
the exultation with which he uttered this helped me somehow for the
instant to meet him rather more and how much will _you_ miles have
to tell him there are things he ll ask you
he turned it over very likely but what things
the things you ve never told me to make up his mind what to do with
you he can t send you back
oh i don t want to go back he broke in i want a new field
he said it with admirable serenity with positive unimpeachable gaiety
and doubtless it was that very note that most evoked for me the
poignancy the unnatural childish tragedy of his probable reappearance
at the end of three months with all this bravado and still more
dishonor it overwhelmed me now that i should never be able to bear
that and it made me let myself go i threw myself upon him and in the
tenderness of my pity i embraced him dear little miles dear little
miles
my face was close to his and he let me kiss him simply taking it with
indulgent good humor well old lady
is there nothing nothing at all that you want to tell me
he turned off a little facing round toward the wall and holding up his
hand to look at as one had seen sick children look i ve told you i
told you this morning
oh i was sorry for him that you just want me not to worry you
he looked round at me now as if in recognition of my understanding
him then ever so gently to let me alone he replied
there was even a singular little dignity in it something that made me
release him yet when i had slowly risen linger beside him god knows
i never wished to harass him but i felt that merely at this to turn
my back on him was to abandon or to put it more truly to lose him
i ve just begun a letter to your uncle i said
well then finish it
i waited a minute what happened before
he gazed up at me again before what
before you came back and before you went away
for some time he was silent but he continued to meet my eyes what
happened
it made me the sound of the words in which it seemed to me that i
caught for the very first time a small faint quaver of consenting
consciousness it made me drop on my knees beside the bed and seize once
more the chance of possessing him dear little miles dear little
miles if you _knew_ how i want to help you it s only that it s
nothing but that and i d rather die than give you a pain or do you a
wrong i d rather die than hurt a hair of you dear little miles oh i
brought it out now even if i _should_ go too far i just want you to
help me to save you but i knew in a moment after this that i had gone
too far the answer to my appeal was instantaneous but it came in the
form of an extraordinary blast and chill a gust of frozen air and a
shake of the room as great as if in the wild wind the casement had
crashed in the boy gave a loud high shriek which lost in the rest
of the shock of sound might have seemed indistinctly though i was so
close to him a note either of jubilation or of terror i jumped to my
feet again and was conscious of darkness so for a moment we remained
while i stared about me and saw that the drawn curtains were unstirred
and the window tight why the candle s out i then cried
it was i who blew it dear said miles
xviii
the next day after lessons mrs grose found a moment to say to me
quietly have you written miss
yes i ve written but i didn t add for the hour that my letter
sealed and directed was still in my pocket there would be time enough
to send it before the messenger should go to the village meanwhile
there had been on the part of my pupils no more brilliant more
exemplary morning it was exactly as if they had both had at heart to
gloss over any recent little friction they performed the dizziest
feats of arithmetic soaring quite out of _my_ feeble range and
perpetrated in higher spirits than ever geographical and historical
jokes it was conspicuous of course in miles in particular that he
appeared to wish to show how easily he could let me down this child
to my memory really lives in a setting of beauty and misery that no
words can translate there was a distinction all his own in every
impulse he revealed never was a small natural creature to the
uninitiated eye all frankness and freedom a more ingenious a more
extraordinary little gentleman i had perpetually to guard against the
wonder of contemplation into which my initiated view betrayed me to
check the irrelevant gaze and discouraged sigh in which i constantly
both attacked and renounced the enigma of what such a little gentleman
could have done that deserved a penalty say that by the dark prodigy
i knew the imagination of all evil _had_ been opened up to him all
the justice within me ached for the proof that it could ever have
flowered into an act
he had never at any rate been such a little gentleman as when after
our early dinner on this dreadful day he came round to me and asked if
i shouldn t like him for half an hour to play to me david playing to
saul could never have shown a finer sense of the occasion it was
literally a charming exhibition of tact of magnanimity and quite
tantamount to his saying outright the true knights we love to read
about never push an advantage too far i know what you mean now you
mean that to be let alone yourself and not followed up you ll cease to
worry and spy upon me won t keep me so close to you will let me go
and come well i come you see but i don t go there ll be plenty of
time for that i do really delight in your society and i only want to
show you that i contended for a principle it may be imagined whether
i resisted this appeal or failed to accompany him again hand in hand
to the schoolroom he sat down at the old piano and played as he had
never played and if there are those who think he had better have been
kicking a football i can only say that i wholly agree with them for at
the end of a time that under his influence i had quite ceased to
measure i started up with a strange sense of having literally slept at
my post it was after luncheon and by the schoolroom fire and yet i
hadn t really in the least slept i had only done something much
worse i had forgotten where all this time was flora when i put the
question to miles he played on a minute before answering and then
could only say why my dear how do _i_ know breaking moreover into
a happy laugh which immediately after as if it were a vocal
accompaniment he prolonged into incoherent extravagant song
i went straight to my room but his sister was not there then before
going downstairs i looked into several others as she was nowhere
about she would surely be with mrs grose whom in the comfort of that
theory i accordingly proceeded in quest of i found her where i had
found her the evening before but she met my quick challenge with
blank scared ignorance she had only supposed that after the repast
i had carried off both the children as to which she was quite in her
right for it was the very first time i had allowed the little girl out
of my sight without some special provision of course now indeed she
might be with the maids so that the immediate thing was to look for
her without an air of alarm this we promptly arranged between us but
when ten minutes later and in pursuance of our arrangement we met in
the hall it was only to report on either side that after guarded
inquiries we had altogether failed to trace her for a minute there
apart from observation we exchanged mute alarms and i could feel with
what high interest my friend returned me all those i had from the first
given her
she ll be above she presently said in one of the rooms you haven t
searched
no she s at a distance i had made up my mind she has gone out
mrs grose stared without a hat
i naturally also looked volumes isn t that woman always without one
she s with _her _
she s with _her _ i declared we must find them
my hand was on my friend s arm but she failed for the moment
confronted with such an account of the matter to respond to my
pressure she communed on the contrary on the spot with her
uneasiness and where s master miles
oh _he s_ with quint they re in the schoolroom
lord miss my view i was myself aware and therefore i suppose my
tone had never yet reached so calm an assurance
the trick s played i went on they ve successfully worked their
plan he found the most divine little way to keep me quiet while she
went off
divine mrs grose bewilderedly echoed
infernal then i almost cheerfully rejoined he has provided for
himself as well but come
she had helplessly gloomed at the upper regions you leave him
so long with quint yes i don t mind that now
she always ended at these moments by getting possession of my hand
and in this manner she could at present still stay me but after
gasping an instant at my sudden resignation because of your letter
she eagerly brought out
i quickly by way of answer felt for my letter drew it forth held it
up and then freeing myself went and laid it on the great hall table
luke will take it i said as i came back i reached the house door
and opened it i was already on the steps
my companion still demurred the storm of the night and the early
morning had dropped but the afternoon was damp and gray i came down
to the drive while she stood in the doorway you go with nothing on
what do i care when the child has nothing i can t wait to dress i
cried and if you must do so i leave you try meanwhile yourself
upstairs
with _them _ oh on this the poor woman promptly joined me
xix
we went straight to the lake as it was called at bly and i daresay
rightly called though i reflect that it may in fact have been a sheet
of water less remarkable than it appeared to my untraveled eyes my
acquaintance with sheets of water was small and the pool of bly at
all events on the few occasions of my consenting under the protection
of my pupils to affront its surface in the old flat bottomed boat
moored there for our use had impressed me both with its extent and its
agitation the usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the
house but i had an intimate conviction that wherever flora might be
she was not near home she had not given me the slip for any small
adventure and since the day of the very great one that i had shared
with her by the pond i had been aware in our walks of the quarter to
which she most inclined this was why i had now given to mrs grose s
steps so marked a direction a direction that made her when she
perceived it oppose a resistance that showed me she was freshly
mystified you re going to the water miss you think she s _in_
she may be though the depth is i believe nowhere very great but
what i judge most likely is that she s on the spot from which the
other day we saw together what i told you
when she pretended not to see
with that astounding self possession i ve always been sure she wanted
to go back alone and now her brother has managed it for her
mrs grose still stood where she had stopped you suppose they really
_talk_ of them
i could meet this with a confidence they say things that if we heard
them would simply appall us
and if she _is_ there
yes
then miss jessel is
beyond a doubt you shall see
oh thank you my friend cried planted so firm that taking it in i
went straight on without her by the time i reached the pool however
she was close behind me and i knew that whatever to her
apprehension might befall me the exposure of my society struck her as
her least danger she exhaled a moan of relief as we at last came in
sight of the greater part of the water without a sight of the child
there was no trace of flora on that nearer side of the bank where my
observation of her had been most startling and none on the opposite
edge where save for a margin of some twenty yards a thick copse came
down to the water the pond oblong in shape had a width so scant
compared to its length that with its ends out of view it might have
been taken for a scant river we looked at the empty expanse and then
i felt the suggestion of my friend s eyes i knew what she meant and i
replied with a negative headshake
no no wait she has taken the boat
my companion stared at the vacant mooring place and then again across
the lake then where is it
our not seeing it is the strongest of proofs she has used it to go
over and then has managed to hide it
all alone that child
she s not alone and at such times she s not a child she s an old
old woman i scanned all the visible shore while mrs grose took
again into the queer element i offered her one of her plunges of
submission then i pointed out that the boat might perfectly be in a
small refuge formed by one of the recesses of the pool an indentation
masked for the hither side by a projection of the bank and by a clump
of trees growing close to the water
but if the boat s there where on earth s _she _ my colleague
anxiously asked
that s exactly what we must learn and i started to walk further
by going all the way round
certainly far as it is it will take us but ten minutes but it s far
enough to have made the child prefer not to walk she went straight
over
laws cried my friend again the chain of my logic was ever too much
for her it dragged her at my heels even now and when we had got
halfway round a devious tiresome process on ground much broken and by
a path choked with overgrowth i paused to give her breath i sustained
her with a grateful arm assuring her that she might hugely help me
and this started us afresh so that in the course of but few minutes
more we reached a point from which we found the boat to be where i had
supposed it it had been intentionally left as much as possible out of
sight and was tied to one of the stakes of a fence that came just
there down to the brink and that had been an assistance to
disembarking i recognized as i looked at the pair of short thick
oars quite safely drawn up the prodigious character of the feat for a
little girl but i had lived by this time too long among wonders and
had panted to too many livelier measures there was a gate in the
fence through which we passed and that brought us after a trifling
interval more into the open then there she is we both exclaimed
at once
flora a short way off stood before us on the grass and smiled as if
her performance was now complete the next thing she did however was
to stoop straight down and pluck quite as if it were all she was there
for a big ugly spray of withered fern i instantly became sure she had
just come out of the copse she waited for us not herself taking a
step and i was conscious of the rare solemnity with which we presently
approached her she smiled and smiled and we met but it was all done
in a silence by this time flagrantly ominous mrs grose was the first
to break the spell she threw herself on her knees and drawing the
child to her breast clasped in a long embrace the little tender
yielding body while this dumb convulsion lasted i could only watch
it which i did the more intently when i saw flora s face peep at me
over our companion s shoulder it was serious now the flicker had left
it but it strengthened the pang with which i at that moment envied
mrs grose the simplicity of _her_ relation still all this while
nothing more passed between us save that flora had let her foolish fern
again drop to the ground what she and i had virtually said to each
other was that pretexts were useless now when mrs grose finally got
up she kept the child s hand so that the two were still before me and
the singular reticence of our communion was even more marked in the
frank look she launched me i ll be hanged it said if _i ll_
speak
it was flora who gazing all over me in candid wonder was the first
she was struck with our bareheaded aspect why where are your
things
where yours are my dear i promptly returned
she had already got back her gaiety and appeared to take this as an
answer quite sufficient and where s miles she went on
there was something in the small valor of it that quite finished me
these three words from her were in a flash like the glitter of a drawn
blade the jostle of the cup that my hand for weeks and weeks had
held high and full to the brim that now even before speaking i felt
overflow in a deluge i ll tell you if you ll tell _me_ i heard
myself say then heard the tremor in which it broke
well what
mrs grose s suspense blazed at me but it was too late now and i
brought the thing out handsomely where my pet is miss jessel
xx
just as in the churchyard with miles the whole thing was upon us much
as i had made of the fact that this name had never once between us
been sounded the quick smitten glare with which the child s face now
received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a
pane of glass it added to the interposing cry as if to stay the blow
that mrs grose at the same instant uttered over my violence the
shriek of a creature scared or rather wounded which in turn within
a few seconds was completed by a gasp of my own i seized my
colleague s arm she s there she s there
miss jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had
stood the other time and i remember strangely as the first feeling
now produced in me my thrill of joy at having brought on a proof she
was there and i was justified she was there and i was neither cruel
nor mad she was there for poor scared mrs grose but she was there
most for flora and no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps so
extraordinary as that in which i consciously threw out to her with the
sense that pale and ravenous demon as she was she would catch and
understand it an inarticulate message of gratitude she rose erect on
the spot my friend and i had lately quitted and there was not in all
the long reach of her desire an inch of her evil that fell short this
first vividness of vision and emotion were things of a few seconds
during which mrs grose s dazed blink across to where i pointed struck
me as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw just as it carried my
own eyes precipitately to the child the revelation then of the manner
in which flora was affected startled me in truth far more than it
would have done to find her also merely agitated for direct dismay was
of course not what i had expected prepared and on her guard as our
pursuit had actually made her she would repress every betrayal and i
was therefore shaken on the spot by my first glimpse of the
particular one for which i had not allowed to see her without a
convulsion of her small pink face not even feign to glance in the
direction of the prodigy i announced but only instead of that turn
at _me_ an expression of hard still gravity an expression absolutely
new and unprecedented and that appeared to read and accuse and judge
me this was a stroke that somehow converted the little girl herself
into the very presence that could make me quail i quailed even though
my certitude that she thoroughly saw was never greater than at that
instant and in the immediate need to defend myself i called it
passionately to witness she s there you little unhappy thing there
there _there_ and you see her as well as you see me i had said
shortly before to mrs grose that she was not at these times a child
but an old old woman and that description of her could not have been
more strikingly confirmed than in the way in which for all answer to
this she simply showed me without a concession an admission of her
eyes a countenance of deeper and deeper of indeed suddenly quite
fixed reprobation i was by this time if i can put the whole thing at
all together more appalled at what i may properly call her manner than
at anything else though it was simultaneously with this that i became
aware of having mrs grose also and very formidably to reckon with
my elder companion the next moment at any rate blotted out
everything but her own flushed face and her loud shocked protest a
burst of high disapproval what a dreadful turn to be sure miss
where on earth do you see anything
i could only grasp her more quickly yet for even while she spoke the
hideous plain presence stood undimmed and undaunted it had already
lasted a minute and it lasted while i continued seizing my colleague
quite thrusting her at it and presenting her to it to insist with my
pointing hand you don t see her exactly as _we_ see you mean to say
you don t now _now _ she s as big as a blazing fire only look dearest
woman _look_ she looked even as i did and gave me with her deep
groan of negation repulsion compassion the mixture with her pity of
her relief at her exemption a sense touching to me even then that she
would have backed me up if she could i might well have needed that
for with this hard blow of the proof that her eyes were hopelessly
sealed i felt my own situation horribly crumble i felt i saw my livid
predecessor press from her position on my defeat and i was
conscious more than all of what i should have from this instant to
deal with in the astounding little attitude of flora into this
attitude mrs grose immediately and violently entered breaking even
while there pierced through my sense of ruin a prodigious private
triumph into breathless reassurance
she isn t there little lady and nobody s there and you never see
nothing my sweet how can poor miss jessel when poor miss jessel s
dead and buried _we_ know don t we love and she appealed
blundering in to the child it s all a mere mistake and a worry and a
joke and we ll go home as fast as we can
our companion on this had responded with a strange quick primness of
propriety and they were again with mrs grose on her feet united as
it were in pained opposition to me flora continued to fix me with her
small mask of reprobation and even at that minute i prayed god to
forgive me for seeming to see that as she stood there holding tight to
our friend s dress her incomparable childish beauty had suddenly
failed had quite vanished i ve said it already she was literally she
was hideously hard she had turned common and almost ugly i don t
know what you mean i see nobody i see nothing i never _have_ i
think you re cruel i don t like you then after this deliverance
which might have been that of a vulgarly pert little girl in the
street she hugged mrs grose more closely and buried in her skirts the
dreadful little face in this position she produced an almost furious
wail take me away take me away oh take me away from _her _
from _me _ i panted
from you from you she cried
even mrs grose looked across at me dismayed while i had nothing to do
but communicate again with the figure that on the opposite bank
without a movement as rigidly still as if catching beyond the
interval our voices was as vividly there for my disaster as it was
not there for my service the wretched child had spoken exactly as if
she had got from some outside source each of her stabbing little words
and i could therefore in the full despair of all i had to accept but
sadly shake my head at her if i had ever doubted all my doubt would
at present have gone i ve been living with the miserable truth and
now it has only too much closed round me of course i ve lost you i ve
interfered and you ve seen under _her_ dictation with which i faced
over the pool again our infernal witness the easy and perfect way to
meet it i ve done my best but i ve lost you goodbye for mrs grose
i had an imperative an almost frantic go go before which in
infinite distress but mutely possessed of the little girl and clearly
convinced in spite of her blindness that something awful had occurred
and some collapse engulfed us she retreated by the way we had come
as fast as she could move
of what first happened when i was left alone i had no subsequent
memory i only knew that at the end of i suppose a quarter of an
hour an odorous dampness and roughness chilling and piercing my
trouble had made me understand that i must have thrown myself on my
face on the ground and given way to a wildness of grief i must have
lain there long and cried and sobbed for when i raised my head the day
was almost done i got up and looked a moment through the twilight at
the gray pool and its blank haunted edge and then i took back to the
house my dreary and difficult course when i reached the gate in the
fence the boat to my surprise was gone so that i had a fresh
reflection to make on flora s extraordinary command of the situation
she passed that night by the most tacit and i should add were not
the word so grotesque a false note the happiest of arrangements with
mrs grose i saw neither of them on my return but on the other hand
as by an ambiguous compensation i saw a great deal of miles i saw i
can use no other phrase so much of him that it was as if it were more
than it had ever been no evening i had passed at bly had the
portentous quality of this one in spite of which and in spite also of
the deeper depths of consternation that had opened beneath my
feet there was literally in the ebbing actual an extraordinarily
sweet sadness on reaching the house i had never so much as looked for
the boy i had simply gone straight to my room to change what i was
wearing and to take in at a glance much material testimony to flora s
rupture her little belongings had all been removed when later by the
schoolroom fire i was served with tea by the usual maid i indulged
on the article of my other pupil in no inquiry whatever he had his
freedom now he might have it to the end well he did have it and it
consisted in part at least of his coming in at about eight o clock and
sitting down with me in silence on the removal of the tea things i had
blown out the candles and drawn my chair closer i was conscious of a
mortal coldness and felt as if i should never again be warm so when
he appeared i was sitting in the glow with my thoughts he paused a
moment by the door as if to look at me then as if to share them came
to the other side of the hearth and sank into a chair we sat there in
absolute stillness yet he wanted i felt to be with me
xxi
before a new day in my room had fully broken my eyes opened to mrs
grose who had come to my bedside with worse news flora was so
markedly feverish that an illness was perhaps at hand she had passed a
night of extreme unrest a night agitated above all by fears that had
for their subject not in the least her former but wholly her present
governess it was not against the possible re entrance of miss jessel
on the scene that she protested it was conspicuously and passionately
against mine i was promptly on my feet of course and with an immense
deal to ask the more that my friend had discernibly now girded her
loins to meet me once more this i felt as soon as i had put to her the
question of her sense of the child s sincerity as against my own she
persists in denying to you that she saw or has ever seen anything
my visitor s trouble truly was great ah miss it isn t a matter on
which i can push her yet it isn t either i must say as if i much
needed to it has made her every inch of her quite old
oh i see her perfectly from here she resents for all the world like
some high little personage the imputation on her truthfulness and as
it were her respectability miss jessel indeed _she _ ah she s
respectable the chit the impression she gave me there yesterday
was i assure you the very strangest of all it was quite beyond any
of the others i _did_ put my foot in it she ll never speak to me
again
hideous and obscure as it all was it held mrs grose briefly silent
then she granted my point with a frankness which i made sure had more
behind it i think indeed miss she never will she do have a grand
manner about it
and that manner i summed it up is practically what s the matter with
her now
oh that manner i could see in my visitor s face and not a little
else besides she asks me every three minutes if i think you re coming
in
i see i see i too on my side had so much more than worked it out
has she said to you since yesterday except to repudiate her
familiarity with anything so dreadful a single other word about miss
jessel
not one miss and of course you know my friend added i took it
from her by the lake that just then and there at least there _was_
nobody
rather and naturally you take it from her still
i don t contradict her what else can i do
nothing in the world you ve the cleverest little person to deal with
they ve made them their two friends i mean still cleverer even than
nature did for it was wondrous material to play on flora has now her
grievance and she ll work it to the end
yes miss but to _what_ end
why that of dealing with me to her uncle she ll make me out to him
the lowest creature
i winced at the fair show of the scene in mrs grose s face she looked
for a minute as if she sharply saw them together and him who thinks
so well of you
he has an odd way it comes over me now i laughed of proving it
but that doesn t matter what flora wants of course is to get rid of
me
my companion bravely concurred never again to so much as look at
you
so that what you ve come to me now for i asked is to speed me on
my way before she had time to reply however i had her in check
i ve a better idea the result of my reflections my going _would_ seem
the right thing and on sunday i was terribly near it yet that won t
do it s _you_ who must go you must take flora
my visitor at this did speculate but where in the world
away from here away from _them_ away even most of all now from
me straight to her uncle
only to tell on you
no not only to leave me in addition with my remedy
she was still vague and what _is_ your remedy
your loyalty to begin with and then miles s
she looked at me hard do you think he
won t if he has the chance turn on me yes i venture still to think
it at all events i want to try get off with his sister as soon as
possible and leave me with him alone i was amazed myself at the
spirit i had still in reserve and therefore perhaps a trifle the more
disconcerted at the way in which in spite of this fine example of it
she hesitated there s one thing of course i went on they
mustn t before she goes see each other for three seconds then it
came over me that in spite of flora s presumable sequestration from
the instant of her return from the pool it might already be too late
do you mean i anxiously asked that they _have_ met
at this she quite flushed ah miss i m not such a fool as that if
i ve been obliged to leave her three or four times it has been each
time with one of the maids and at present though she s alone she s
locked in safe and yet and yet there were too many things
and yet what
well are you so sure of the little gentleman
i m not sure of anything but _you_ but i have since last evening a
new hope i think he wants to give me an opening i do believe
that poor little exquisite wretch he wants to speak last evening in
the firelight and the silence he sat with me for two hours as if it
were just coming
mrs grose looked hard through the window at the gray gathering day
and did it come
no though i waited and waited i confess it didn t and it was
without a breach of the silence or so much as a faint allusion to his
sister s condition and absence that we at last kissed for good night
all the same i continued i can t if her uncle sees her consent to
his seeing her brother without my having given the boy and most of all
because things have got so bad a little more time
my friend appeared on this ground more reluctant than i could quite
understand what do you mean by more time
well a day or two really to bring it out he ll then be on _my_
side of which you see the importance if nothing comes i shall only
fail and you will at the worst have helped me by doing on your
arrival in town whatever you may have found possible so i put it
before her but she continued for a little so inscrutably embarrassed
that i came again to her aid unless indeed i wound up you really
want _not_ to go
i could see it in her face at last clear itself she put out her hand
to me as a pledge i ll go i ll go i ll go this morning
i wanted to be very just if you _should_ wish still to wait i would
engage she shouldn t see me
no no it s the place itself she must leave it she held me a
moment with heavy eyes then brought out the rest your idea s the
right one i myself miss
well
i can t stay
the look she gave me with it made me jump at possibilities you mean
that since yesterday you _have_ seen
she shook her head with dignity i ve _heard_
heard
from that child horrors there she sighed with tragic relief on my
honor miss she says things but at this evocation she broke down
she dropped with a sudden sob upon my sofa and as i had seen her do
before gave way to all the grief of it
it was quite in another manner that i for my part let myself go oh
thank god
she sprang up again at this drying her eyes with a groan thank
god
it so justifies me
it does that miss
i couldn t have desired more emphasis but i just hesitated she s so
horrible
i saw my colleague scarce knew how to put it really shocking
and about me
about you miss since you must have it it s beyond everything for a
young lady and i can t think wherever she must have picked up
the appalling language she applied to me i can then i broke in
with a laugh that was doubtless significant enough
it only in truth left my friend still more grave well perhaps i
ought to also since i ve heard some of it before yet i can t bear it
the poor woman went on while with the same movement she glanced on
my dressing table at the face of my watch but i must go back
i kept her however ah if you can t bear it
how can i stop with her you mean why just _for_ that to get her
away far from this she pursued far from _them_
she may be different she may be free i seized her almost with joy
then in spite of yesterday you _believe_
in such doings her simple description of them required in the light
of her expression to be carried no further and she gave me the whole
thing as she had never done i believe
yes it was a joy and we were still shoulder to shoulder if i might
continue sure of that i should care but little what else happened my
support in the presence of disaster would be the same as it had been in
my early need of confidence and if my friend would answer for my
honesty i would answer for all the rest on the point of taking leave
of her nonetheless i was to some extent embarrassed there s one
thing of course it occurs to me to remember my letter giving the
alarm will have reached town before you
i now perceived still more how she had been beating about the bush and
how weary at last it had made her your letter won t have got there
your letter never went
what then became of it
goodness knows master miles
do you mean _he_ took it i gasped
she hung fire but she overcame her reluctance i mean that i saw
yesterday when i came back with miss flora that it wasn t where you
had put it later in the evening i had the chance to question luke and
he declared that he had neither noticed nor touched it we could only
exchange on this one of our deeper mutual soundings and it was mrs
grose who first brought up the plumb with an almost elated you see
yes i see that if miles took it instead he probably will have read it
and destroyed it
and don t you see anything else
i faced her a moment with a sad smile it strikes me that by this time
your eyes are open even wider than mine
they proved to be so indeed but she could still blush almost to show
it i make out now what he must have done at school and she gave in
her simple sharpness an almost droll disillusioned nod he stole
i turned it over i tried to be more judicial well perhaps
she looked as if she found me unexpectedly calm he stole _letters _
she couldn t know my reasons for a calmness after all pretty shallow
so i showed them off as i might i hope then it was to more purpose
than in this case the note at any rate that i put on the table
yesterday i pursued will have given him so scant an advantage for
it contained only the bare demand for an interview that he is already
much ashamed of having gone so far for so little and that what he had
on his mind last evening was precisely the need of confession i
seemed to myself for the instant to have mastered it to see it all
leave us leave us i was already at the door hurrying her off
i ll get it out of him he ll meet me he ll confess if he confesses
he s saved and if he s saved
then _you_ are the dear woman kissed me on this and i took her
farewell i ll save you without him she cried as she went
xxii
yet it was when she had got off and i missed her on the spot that the
great pinch really came if i had counted on what it would give me to
find myself alone with miles i speedily perceived at least that it
would give me a measure no hour of my stay in fact was so assailed
with apprehensions as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage
containing mrs grose and my younger pupil had already rolled out of
the gates now i _was_ i said to myself face to face with the
elements and for much of the rest of the day while i fought my
weakness i could consider that i had been supremely rash it was a
tighter place still than i had yet turned round in all the more that
for the first time i could see in the aspect of others a confused
reflection of the crisis what had happened naturally caused them all
to stare there was too little of the explained throw out whatever we
might in the suddenness of my colleague s act the maids and the men
looked blank the effect of which on my nerves was an aggravation until
i saw the necessity of making it a positive aid it was precisely in
short by just clutching the helm that i avoided total wreck and i
dare say that to bear up at all i became that morning very grand
and very dry i welcomed the consciousness that i was charged with much
to do and i caused it to be known as well that left thus to myself i
was quite remarkably firm i wandered with that manner for the next
hour or two all over the place and looked i have no doubt as if i
were ready for any onset so for the benefit of whom it might concern
i paraded with a sick heart
the person it appeared least to concern proved to be till dinner
little miles himself my perambulations had given me meanwhile no
glimpse of him but they had tended to make more public the change
taking place in our relation as a consequence of his having at the
piano the day before kept me in flora s interest so beguiled and
befooled the stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her
confinement and departure and the change itself was now ushered in by
our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom he had
already disappeared when on my way down i pushed open his door and i
learned below that he had breakfasted in the presence of a couple of
the maids with mrs grose and his sister he had then gone out as he
said for a stroll than which nothing i reflected could better have
expressed his frank view of the abrupt transformation of my office
what he would not permit this office to consist of was yet to be
settled there was a queer relief at all events i mean for myself in
especial in the renouncement of one pretension if so much had sprung
to the surface i scarce put it too strongly in saying that what had
perhaps sprung highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction
that i had anything more to teach him it sufficiently stuck out that
by tacit little tricks in which even more than myself he carried out
the care for my dignity i had had to appeal to him to let me off
straining to meet him on the ground of his true capacity he had at any
rate his freedom now i was never to touch it again as i had amply
shown moreover when on his joining me in the schoolroom the previous
night i had uttered on the subject of the interval just concluded
neither challenge nor hint i had too much from this moment my other
ideas yet when he at last arrived the difficulty of applying them
the accumulations of my problem were brought straight home to me by
the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet
for the eye dropped neither stain nor shadow
to mark for the house the high state i cultivated i decreed that my
meals with the boy should be served as we called it downstairs so
that i had been awaiting him in the ponderous pomp of the room outside
of the window of which i had had from mrs grose that first scared
sunday my flash of something it would scarce have done to call light
here at present i felt afresh for i had felt it again and again how my
equilibrium depended on the success of my rigid will the will to shut
my eyes as tight as possible to the truth that what i had to deal with
was revoltingly against nature i could only get on at all by taking
nature into my confidence and my account by treating my monstrous
ordeal as a push in a direction unusual of course and unpleasant but
demanding after all for a fair front only another turn of the screw
of ordinary human virtue no attempt nonetheless could well require
more tact than just this attempt to supply one s self _all_ the
nature how could i put even a little of that article into a
suppression of reference to what had occurred how on the other hand
could i make reference without a new plunge into the hideous obscure
well a sort of answer after a time had come to me and it was so far
confirmed as that i was met incontestably by the quickened vision of
what was rare in my little companion it was indeed as if he had found
even now as he had so often found at lessons still some other delicate
way to ease me off wasn t there light in the fact which as we shared
our solitude broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet quite
worn the fact that opportunity aiding precious opportunity which had
now come it would be preposterous with a child so endowed to forego
the help one might wrest from absolute intelligence what had his
intelligence been given him for but to save him mightn t one to reach
his mind risk the stretch of an angular arm over his character it was
as if when we were face to face in the dining room he had literally
shown me the way the roast mutton was on the table and i had
dispensed with attendance miles before he sat down stood a moment
with his hands in his pockets and looked at the joint on which he
seemed on the point of passing some humorous judgment but what he
presently produced was i say my dear is she really very awfully
ill
little flora not so bad but that she ll presently be better london
will set her up bly had ceased to agree with her come here and take
your mutton
he alertly obeyed me carried the plate carefully to his seat and
when he was established went on did bly disagree with her so
terribly suddenly
not so suddenly as you might think one had seen it coming on
then why didn t you get her off before
before what
before she became too ill to travel
i found myself prompt she s _not_ too ill to travel she only might
have become so if she had stayed this was just the moment to seize
the journey will dissipate the influence oh i was grand and carry
it off
i see i see miles for that matter was grand too he settled to
his repast with the charming little table manner that from the day
of his arrival had relieved me of all grossness of admonition
whatever he had been driven from school for it was not for ugly
feeding he was irreproachable as always today but he was
unmistakably more conscious he was discernibly trying to take for
granted more things than he found without assistance quite easy and
he dropped into peaceful silence while he felt his situation our meal
was of the briefest mine a vain pretense and i had the things
immediately removed while this was done miles stood again with his
hands in his little pockets and his back to me stood and looked out of
the wide window through which that other day i had seen what pulled
me up we continued silent while the maid was with us as silent it
whimsically occurred to me as some young couple who on their wedding
journey at the inn feel shy in the presence of the waiter he turned
round only when the waiter had left us well so we re alone
xxiii
oh more or less i fancy my smile was pale not absolutely we
shouldn t like that i went on
no i suppose we shouldn t of course we have the others
we have the others we have indeed the others i concurred
yet even though we have them he returned still with his hands in
his pockets and planted there in front of me they don t much count
do they
i made the best of it but i felt wan it depends on what you call
much
yes with all accommodation everything depends on this however he
faced to the window again and presently reached it with his vague
restless cogitating step he remained there awhile with his forehead
against the glass in contemplation of the stupid shrubs i knew and the
dull things of november i had always my hypocrisy of work behind
which now i gained the sofa steadying myself with it there as i had
repeatedly done at those moments of torment that i have described as
the moments of my knowing the children to be given to something from
which i was barred i sufficiently obeyed my habit of being prepared
for the worst but an extraordinary impression dropped on me as i
extracted a meaning from the boy s embarrassed back none other than the
impression that i was not barred now this inference grew in a few
minutes to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with the direct
perception that it was positively _he_ who was the frames and squares
of the great window were a kind of image for him of a kind of
failure i felt that i saw him at any rate shut in or shut out he
was admirable but not comfortable i took it in with a throb of hope
wasn t he looking through the haunted pane for something he couldn t
see and wasn t it the first time in the whole business that he had
known such a lapse the first the very first i found it a splendid
portent it made him anxious though he watched himself he had been
anxious all day and even while in his usual sweet little manner he sat
at table had needed all his small strange genius to give it a gloss
when he at last turned round to meet me it was almost as if this
genius had succumbed well i think i m glad bly agrees with _me _
you would certainly seem to have seen these twenty four hours a good
deal more of it than for some time before i hope i went on bravely
that you ve been enjoying yourself
oh yes i ve been ever so far all round about miles and miles away
i ve never been so free
he had really a manner of his own and i could only try to keep up with
him well do you like it
he stood there smiling then at last he put into two words do
_you _ more discrimination than i had ever heard two words contain
before i had time to deal with that however he continued as if with
the sense that this was an impertinence to be softened nothing could
be more charming than the way you take it for of course if we re alone
together now it s you that are alone most but i hope he threw in
you don t particularly mind
having to do with you i asked my dear child how can i help
minding though i ve renounced all claim to your company you re so
beyond me i at least greatly enjoy it what else should i stay on for
he looked at me more directly and the expression of his face graver
now struck me as the most beautiful i had ever found in it you stay
on just for _that _
certainly i stay on as your friend and from the tremendous interest i
take in you till something can be done for you that may be more worth
your while that needn t surprise you my voice trembled so that i
felt it impossible to suppress the shake don t you remember how i
told you when i came and sat on your bed the night of the storm that
there was nothing in the world i wouldn t do for you
yes yes he on his side more and more visibly nervous had a tone
to master but he was so much more successful than i that laughing out
through his gravity he could pretend we were pleasantly jesting only
that i think was to get me to do something for _you _
it was partly to get you to do something i conceded but you know
you didn t do it
oh yes he said with the brightest superficial eagerness you
wanted me to tell you something
that s it out straight out what you have on your mind you know
ah then is _that_ what you ve stayed over for
he spoke with a gaiety through which i could still catch the finest
little quiver of resentful passion but i can t begin to express the
effect upon me of an implication of surrender even so faint it was as
if what i had yearned for had come at last only to astonish me well
yes i may as well make a clean breast of it it was precisely for
that
he waited so long that i supposed it for the purpose of repudiating the
assumption on which my action had been founded but what he finally
said was do you mean now here
there couldn t be a better place or time he looked round him
uneasily and i had the rare oh the queer impression of the very
first symptom i had seen in him of the approach of immediate fear it
was as if he were suddenly afraid of me which struck me indeed as
perhaps the best thing to make him yet in the very pang of the effort
i felt it vain to try sternness and i heard myself the next instant so
gentle as to be almost grotesque you want so to go out again
awfully he smiled at me heroically and the touching little bravery
of it was enhanced by his actually flushing with pain he had picked up
his hat which he had brought in and stood twirling it in a way that
gave me even as i was just nearly reaching port a perverse horror of
what i was doing to do it in _any_ way was an act of violence for
what did it consist of but the obtrusion of the idea of grossness and
guilt on a small helpless creature who had been for me a revelation of
the possibilities of beautiful intercourse wasn t it base to create
for a being so exquisite a mere alien awkwardness i suppose i now read
into our situation a clearness it couldn t have had at the time for i
seem to see our poor eyes already lighted with some spark of a
prevision of the anguish that was to come so we circled about with
terrors and scruples like fighters not daring to close but it was for
each other we feared that kept us a little longer suspended and
unbruised i ll tell you everything miles said i mean i ll tell you
anything you like you ll stay on with me and we shall both be all
right and i _will_ tell you i _will_ but not now
why not now
my insistence turned him from me and kept him once more at his window
in a silence during which between us you might have heard a pin drop
then he was before me again with the air of a person for whom outside
someone who had frankly to be reckoned with was waiting i have to see
luke
i had not yet reduced him to quite so vulgar a lie and i felt
proportionately ashamed but horrible as it was his lies made up my
truth i achieved thoughtfully a few loops of my knitting well then
go to luke and i ll wait for what you promise only in return for
that satisfy before you leave me one very much smaller request
he looked as if he felt he had succeeded enough to be able still a
little to bargain very much smaller
yes a mere fraction of the whole tell me oh my work preoccupied
me and i was offhand if yesterday afternoon from the table in the
hall you took you know my letter
xxiv
my sense of how he received this suffered for a minute from something
that i can describe only as a fierce split of my attention a stroke
that at first as i sprang straight up reduced me to the mere blind
movement of getting hold of him drawing him close and while i just
fell for support against the nearest piece of furniture instinctively
keeping him with his back to the window the appearance was full upon
us that i had already had to deal with here peter quint had come into
view like a sentinel before a prison the next thing i saw was that
from outside he had reached the window and then i knew that close to
the glass and glaring in through it he offered once more to the room
his white face of damnation it represents but grossly what took place
within me at the sight to say that on the second my decision was made
yet i believe that no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time
recovered her grasp of the _act_ it came to me in the very horror of
the immediate presence that the act would be seeing and facing what i
saw and faced to keep the boy himself unaware the inspiration i can
call it by no other name was that i felt how voluntarily how
transcendently i _might_ it was like fighting with a demon for a
human soul and when i had fairly so appraised it i saw how the human
soul held out in the tremor of my hands at arm s length had a perfect
dew of sweat on a lovely childish forehead the face that was close to
mine was as white as the face against the glass and out of it
presently came a sound not low nor weak but as if from much further
away that i drank like a waft of fragrance
yes i took it
at this with a moan of joy i enfolded i drew him close and while i
held him to my breast where i could feel in the sudden fever of his
little body the tremendous pulse of his little heart i kept my eyes on
the thing at the window and saw it move and shift its posture i have
likened it to a sentinel but its slow wheel for a moment was rather
the prowl of a baffled beast my present quickened courage however
was such that not too much to let it through i had to shade as it
were my flame meanwhile the glare of the face was again at the
window the scoundrel fixed as if to watch and wait it was the very
confidence that i might now defy him as well as the positive
certitude by this time of the child s unconsciousness that made me
go on what did you take it for
to see what you said about me
you opened the letter
i opened it
my eyes were now as i held him off a little again on miles s own
face in which the collapse of mockery showed me how complete was the
ravage of uneasiness what was prodigious was that at last by my
success his sense was sealed and his communication stopped he knew
that he was in presence but knew not of what and knew still less that
i also was and that i did know and what did this strain of trouble
matter when my eyes went back to the window only to see that the air
was clear again and by my personal triumph the influence quenched
there was nothing there i felt that the cause was mine and that i
should surely get _all_ and you found nothing i let my elation out
he gave the most mournful thoughtful little headshake nothing
nothing nothing i almost shouted in my joy
nothing nothing he sadly repeated
i kissed his forehead it was drenched so what have you done with
it
i ve burned it
burned it it was now or never is that what you did at school
oh what this brought up at school
did you take letters or other things
other things he appeared now to be thinking of something far off and
that reached him only through the pressure of his anxiety yet it did
reach him did i _steal _
i felt myself redden to the roots of my hair as well as wonder if it
were more strange to put to a gentleman such a question or to see him
take it with allowances that gave the very distance of his fall in the
world was it for that you mightn t go back
the only thing he felt was rather a dreary little surprise did you
know i mightn t go back
i know everything
he gave me at this the longest and strangest look everything
everything therefore _did_ you but i couldn t say it again
miles could very simply no i didn t steal
my face must have shown him i believed him utterly yet my hands but it
was for pure tenderness shook him as if to ask him why if it was all
for nothing he had condemned me to months of torment what then did
you do
he looked in vague pain all round the top of the room and drew his
breath two or three times over as if with difficulty he might have
been standing at the bottom of the sea and raising his eyes to some
faint green twilight well i said things
only that
they thought it was enough
to turn you out for
never truly had a person turned out shown so little to explain it
as this little person he appeared to weigh my question but in a
manner quite detached and almost helpless well i suppose i
oughtn t
but to whom did you say them
he evidently tried to remember but it dropped he had lost it i don t
know
he almost smiled at me in the desolation of his surrender which was
indeed practically by this time so complete that i ought to have left
it there but i was infatuated i was blind with victory though even
then the very effect that was to have brought him so much nearer was
already that of added separation was it to everyone i asked
no it was only to but he gave a sick little headshake i don t
remember their names
were they then so many
no only a few those i liked
those he liked i seemed to float not into clearness but into a darker
obscure and within a minute there had come to me out of my very pity
the appalling alarm of his being perhaps innocent it was for the
instant confounding and bottomless for if he _were_ innocent what
then on earth was _i _ paralyzed while it lasted by the mere brush of
the question i let him go a little so that with a deep drawn sigh
he turned away from me again which as he faced toward the clear
window i suffered feeling that i had nothing now there to keep him
from and did they repeat what you said i went on after a moment
he was soon at some distance from me still breathing hard and again
with the air though now without anger for it of being confined
against his will once more as he had done before he looked up at the
dim day as if of what had hitherto sustained him nothing was left but
an unspeakable anxiety oh yes he nevertheless replied they must
have repeated them to those _they_ liked he added
there was somehow less of it than i had expected but i turned it
over and these things came round
to the masters oh yes he answered very simply but i didn t know
they d tell
the masters they didn t they ve never told that s why i ask you
he turned to me again his little beautiful fevered face yes it was
too bad
too bad
what i suppose i sometimes said to write home
i can t name the exquisite pathos of the contradiction given to such a
speech by such a speaker i only know that the next instant i heard
myself throw off with homely force stuff and nonsense but the next
after that i must have sounded stern enough what _were_ these
things
my sternness was all for his judge his executioner yet it made him
avert himself again and that movement made _me_ with a single bound
and an irrepressible cry spring straight upon him for there again
against the glass as if to blight his confession and stay his answer
was the hideous author of our woe the white face of damnation i felt a
sick swim at the drop of my victory and all the return of my battle so
that the wildness of my veritable leap only served as a great betrayal
i saw him from the midst of my act meet it with a divination and on
the perception that even now he only guessed and that the window was
still to his own eyes free i let the impulse flame up to convert the
climax of his dismay into the very proof of his liberation no more
no more no more i shrieked as i tried to press him against me to
my visitant
is she _here _ miles panted as he caught with his sealed eyes the
direction of my words then as his strange she staggered me and with
a gasp i echoed it miss jessel miss jessel he with a sudden fury
gave me back
i seized stupefied his supposition some sequel to what we had done to
flora but this made me only want to show him that it was better still
than that it s not miss jessel but it s at the window straight
before us it s _there_ the coward horror there for the last time
at this after a second in which his head made the movement of a
baffled dog s on a scent and then gave a frantic little shake for air
and light he was at me in a white rage bewildered glaring vainly
over the place and missing wholly though it now to my sense filled
the room like the taste of poison the wide overwhelming presence
it s _he _
i was so determined to have all my proof that i flashed into ice to
challenge him whom do you mean by he
peter quint you devil his face gave again round the room its
convulsed supplication _where _
they are in my ears still his supreme surrender of the name and his
tribute to my devotion what does he matter now my own what will he
_ever_ matter _i_ have you i launched at the beast but he has lost
you forever then for the demonstration of my work there _there _
i said to miles
but he had already jerked straight round stared glared again and
seen but the quiet day with the stroke of the loss i was so proud of
he uttered the cry of a creature hurled over an abyss and the grasp
with which i recovered him might have been that of catching him in his
fall i caught him yes i held him it may be imagined with what a
passion but at the end of a minute i began to feel what it truly was
that i held we were alone with the quiet day and his little heart
dispossessed had stopped
