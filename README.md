## Build suggestion

This library is header-only, written in portable C++ 17.  MSVC is supported, but occasionally some bugs in MSVC take a long time to be identified, please report MSVC compilation issues.  MSVC is integrated into our continuous integration, but failure to build in MSVC does not block repository changes.

There are comprehensive examples in the Catch2 based tests, here's a simple way to build them:

1. Do not forget to initialize at least the Catch2 submodule (`git submodule update --init --recursive`)
2. Create a build directory (we suggest ~/builds)
3. Create a sub-dir of that directory per branch to build in (this maintains build isolation and avoids polluting your checked out repository)
4. Execute `cmake -g "Unix Makefiles" ~/<path to repository root of your checkout>/test` to generate makefiles.
5. Use `make -j16` (for some parallelism in building) to build testing binaries.

If you understand GitHub actions, see our "actions configuration" file, [`.github/workflows/master.yaml`](https://github.com/thecppzoo/zoo/blob/master/.github/workflows/master.yaml)

`cmake -G Xcode` is supported, however, only the target `zooTestDebugTest` is debuggable within XCode, this is the target with all tests, the individual sections use "object libraries" that XCode is not supporting.

## CPPCon 2022:
March 1: We're working on a release of the code this week (March 3): A complete implementation that may not be production-ready.  Thanks for the interest.

Please contact us for information about the work we are doing for C++ Now 2023, we are working on it privately

## Library of components.
